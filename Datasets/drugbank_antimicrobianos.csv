As with all antibiotics, tobramycin use should be limited to cases where bacterial infections are known or strongly suspected to be caused by sensitive organisms, and the possible emergence of resistance should be monitored closely.[L32739,L32744,L32749]","Tobramycin is a 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS) ring-containing aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity against various Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.[L32739, L32744, L32749] The mechanism of action of tobramycin has not been unambiguously elucidated, and some insights into its mechanism rely on results using similar aminoglycosides. In general, like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is bactericidal and exhibits both immediate and delayed killing, which are attributed to different mechanisms, as outlined below.[A232294, A232299]

Aminoglycosides are polycationic at physiological pH, such that they readily bind to bacterial membranes (""ionic binding""); this includes binding to lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acid and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding displaces divalent cations and increases membrane permeability, which allows aminoglycoside entry.[A232294, A232304, A232309, A232314] Additional aminoglycoside entry (""energy-dependent phase I"") into the cytoplasm requires the proton-motive force, allowing access of the aminoglycoside to its primary intracellular target of the bacterial 30S ribosome.[A232294, A232314] Mistranslated proteins produced as a result of aminoglycoside binding to the ribosome (see below) integrate into and disrupt the cell membrane, which allows more of the aminoglycoside into the cell (""energy-dependent phase II"").[A232294, A232314, A232319] Hence, tobramycin and other aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modelling support this two-mechanism model.[A232294, A232299]

Inhibition of protein synthesis was the first recognized effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.[A232324, A232329] Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects, including inhibiting translation initiation and elongation and ribosome recycling.[A232294, A232334, A232339] Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.[A232329, A232339] Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation;[A232344] mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[A232294, A232319]

Although direct mutation of the 16S rRNA is a rare resistance mechanism, due to the gene being present in numerous copies, posttranscriptional 16S rRNA modification by 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases) at the N7 position of G1405 or the N1 position of A1408 are common resistance mechanisms in aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria.[A232294, A232349] These mutants also further support the proposed mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. Direct modification of the aminoglycoside itself through acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are also commonly encountered resistance mutations.[A232294, A232349] Finally, due to the requirement for active transport of aminoglycosides across bacterial membranes, they are not active against obligately anaerobic bacteria.[A232294]",16S ribosomal RNA|23S ribosomal RNA|Bacterial outer membrane|Cytoplasmic membrane,16s ribosomal rna|23s ribosomal rna|bacterial outer membrane|cytoplasmic membrane,"inhaled tobramycin is indicated for the management of cystic fibrosis patients with _pseudomonas aeruginosa_, but is not recommended in patients under six years of age, those with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev<sub>1</sub>) <25 or >80% predicted, or in those with _burkholderia cepacia_.[l32739,l45364]

inhibition of protein synthesis was the first recognized effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16s rrna in helix 44 (h44), near the a site of the 30s ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. this binding also displaces two important residues, a1492 and a1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the a site.[a232324, a232329] overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects, including inhibiting translation initiation and elongation and ribosome recycling.[a232294, a232334, a232339] recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23s rrna of the 50s ribosomal subunit.[a232329, a232339] also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation;[a232344] mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.[a232294, a232319]

although direct mutation of the 16s rrna is a rare resistance mechanism, due to the gene being present in numerous copies, posttranscriptional 16s rrna modification by 16s rrna methyltransferases (16s-rmtases) at the n7 position of g1405 or the n1 position of a1408 are common resistance mechanisms in aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria.[a232294, a232349] these mutants also further support the proposed mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. direct modification of the aminoglycoside itself through acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (ames) are also commonly encountered resistance mutations.[a232294, a232349] finally, due to the requirement for active transport of aminoglycosides across bacterial membranes, they are not active against obligately anaerobic bacteria.[a232294]"

DB00945,Acetylsalicylic acid,"**Pain, fever, and inflammation**

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. 

The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].

**Other indications**

ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: 

Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. 

Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].

For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].

For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label]. 

For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].

Used for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label]. 

**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**

In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].","Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) blocks prostaglandin synthesis. It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes [A177241, A10989, A32682]. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation [FDA label].  Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 

It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 [A32682, A177256].  ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor [A177268]. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition [A177325].",Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1|3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase|Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2|Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1|5'-AMP-activated protein kinase|Endothelin-1 receptor|Cellular tumor antigen p53|Endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP|Ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-3|NF-kappa-B inhibitor alpha|Tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein|Caspase-1|Caspase-3|Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta|Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)|G1/S-specific cyclin-D1|Myc proto-oncogene protein|Proliferating cell nuclear antigen|Cyclin A|Sialidase-1,prostaglandin g/h synthase 1|3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase|prostaglandin g/h synthase 2|aldo-keto reductase family 1 member c1|5'-amp-activated protein kinase|endothelin-1 receptor|cellular tumor antigen p53|endoplasmic reticulum chaperone bip|ribosomal protein s6 kinase alpha-3|nf-kappa-b inhibitor alpha|tumor necrosis factor-inducible gene 6 protein|caspase-1|caspase-3|inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-b kinase subunit beta|extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk)|g1/s-specific cyclin-d1|myc proto-oncogene protein|proliferating cell nuclear antigen|cyclin a|sialidase-1,"**pain, fever, and inflammation**

DB01593,Zinc,"Zinc can be used for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency/its consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, and slowed wound healing. It is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [L2172].","**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].

Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].

In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].

There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].

Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].

The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 

In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].

In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].

The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].","B1 bradykinin receptor|Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase|Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A|Elongation factor 1-alpha

This occurs through the irreversible inhibition of beta-lactamase enzymes. In addition, tazobactam may bind covalently to plasmid-mediated and chromosome-mediated beta-lactamase enzymes. Tazobactam is predominantly effective against the OHIO-1, SHV-1, and TEM groups of beta-lactamases, but may also inhibit other beta-lactamases.[A179386,A179389,A179395]

**tazobactam-piperacillin**

when combined with piperacillin, it is used to treat a variety of infections, including those caused by aerobic and facultative gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, in addition to gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. some examples of infections treated with piperacillin-tazobactam include cellulitis, diabetic foot infections, appendicitis, and postpartum endometritis infections.[l4417] certain gram-negative bacilli infections with beta-lactamase producing organisms cannot be treated with piperacillin-tazobactam, due to a gene mutation conferring antibiotic resistance.[a179266]

DB09130,Copper,For use in the supplementation of total parenteral nutrition and in contraception with intrauterine devices [FDA Label] [L801].,"Copper is absorbed from the gut via high affinity copper uptake protein and likely through low affinity copper uptake protein and natural resistance-associated macrophage protein-2 [A19528]. It is believed that copper is reduced to the Cu1+ form prior to transport. Once inside the enterocyte, it is bound to copper transport protein ATOX1 which shuttles the ion to copper transporting ATPase-1 on the golgi membrane which take up copper into the golgi apparatus. Once copper has been secreted by enterocytes into the systemic circulation it remain largely bound by ceruloplasmin (65-90%), albumin (18%), and alpha 2-macroglobulin (12%). 

Copper is an essential element in the body and is incorporated into many oxidase enzymes as a cofactor [A19518]. It is also a component of zinc/copper super oxide dismutase, giving it an anti-oxidant role. Copper defiency occurs in Occipital Horn Syndrome and Menke's disease both of which are associated with impaired development of connective tissue due to the lack of copper to act as a cofactor in protein-lysine-6-oxidase. Menke's disease is also associated with progressive neurological impairment leading to death in infancy. The precise mechanisms of the effects of copper deficiency are vague due to the wide range of enzymes which use the ion as a cofactor.

Copper appears to reduce the viabilty and motility of spermatozoa [A19526]. This reduces the likelihood of fertilization with a copper IUD, producing copper's contraceptive effect [A19526]. The exact mechanism of copper's effect on sperm are unknown.","Amyloid-beta precursor protein|Adenosylhomocysteinase|Histone H2B type 1-C/E/F/G/I|Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase|Nucleoside

DB11638,Artenimol,"For the treatment of uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* infection in adults, children, and infants aged 6 months and up weighing over 5 kg [FDA Label]. Used in combination with [DB13941].","Artemisinins, including Artenimol which is a major active metabolite of many artemisinins, are thought to act via a common mechanism [A31589]. While the exact mechanism of action is not certain, theories exist as to how artemisinins produce their antimalarial effect.

Artemisinins are believed to bind to haem within the *P. falciparum* parasite [A31564, A31588]. The source of this haem varies with the life stage of the parasite. When the parasite is in the early ring stage artemisinins are believed to bind haem produced by the parasite's haem biosynthesis pathway. In later stages artemisinins likely bind to haem released by haemoglobin digestion. Once bound to haem, artemisinins are thought to undergo activation involving ferrous iron via reductive scission which splits the endoperoxide bridge to produce a reactive oxygen [A31587, A31596]. This reactive oxygen is thought to undergo a subsequent intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce a reactive carbon radical [A31596]. The carbon radical is believed to be the source of the drugs potent activity against *P. falciparum* by alkylating a wide array of protein targets [A20257, A31564, A31596]. The nature and magnitude of the effect on specific protein function as a result of this alkylation is unknown.

One target which has been the focus of research is the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump of *P. falciparum* [A31594]. Artemisinins have been found to irreversably bind to and inhibit this protein at a binding site similar to that of Thapsigargin. The mechanism is likely the same as for other proteins, namely alkylation via the carbon radical intermediate.

Artemisinins appear to preferentially collect in infected erythrocytes, concentrating the drug by several hundred-fold compared to uninfected cells [A31597]. This may play a role in why little alkylation is seen in uninfected erythrocytes [A31595].","Actin, cytoplasmic 2|Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase|Annexin A2|ATP synthase subunit alpha,

weighing over 5 kg [fda label]. used in combination with [db13941].","artemisinins, including artenimol which is a major active metabolite of many artemisinins, are thought to act via a common mechanism [a31589]. while the exact mechanism of action is not certain, theories exist as to how artemisinins produce their antimalarial effect.

artemisinins are believed to bind to haem within the *p. falciparum* parasite [a31564, a31588]. the source of this haem varies with the life stage of the parasite. when the parasite is in the early ring stage artemisinins are believed to bind haem produced by the parasite's haem biosynthesis pathway. in later stages artemisinins likely bind to haem released by haemoglobin digestion. once bound to haem, artemisinins are thought to undergo activation involving ferrous iron via reductive scission which splits the endoperoxide bridge to produce a reactive oxygen [a31587, a31596]. this reactive oxygen is thought to undergo a subsequent intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce a reactive carbon radical [a31596]. the carbon radical is believed to be the source of the drugs potent activity against *p. falciparum* by alkylating a wide array of protein targets [a20257, a31564, a31596]. the nature and magnitude of the effect on specific protein function as a result of this alkylation is unknown.

one target which has been the focus of research is the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase pump of *p. falciparum* [a31594]. artemisinins have been found to irreversably bind to and inhibit this protein at a binding site similar to that of thapsigargin. the mechanism is likely the same as for other proteins, namely alkylation via the carbon radical intermediate.

artemisinins appear to preferentially collect in infected erythrocytes, concentrating the drug by several hundred-fold compared to uninfected cells [a31597]. this may play a role in why little alkylation is seen in uninfected erythrocytes [a31595]."

DB12010,Fostamatinib,Fostamatinib is indicated for use in the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in patients who have had insufficient response to previous therapy [FDA Label].,"The active metabolite of fostamatinib, R406, is an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) [A32899]. It binds reversibly to the ATP binding pocket with high affinity (Ki = 30nM), inhibiting the kinase activity with an IC50 of 41nM.

Syk is a cytosolic protein kinase and part of the signalling cascade which occurs with Fc receptors, TCRs, and BCRs [A32898]. It contains two src homology 2 (SH2) domains separated by a linker domain. These SH2 domains bind to tyrosine residues on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif phosphorylated by Lyn, another kinase in the cascade. This motif is located on the cytoplasmic regions of several immune receptors including Fc receptors, TCRs, BCRs, and natural killer cell receptors. The flexibility provided by the linker enables the protein to bind to many receptor types. Inhibition of Syk suppresses downstream signal transduction [A32899].

While Syk plays a role in some pathways involved in the generation of the oxidative burst by neutrophils or phagocytosis by macrophages, R406 does not have a significant effect on these processes [A32899]. This is likely due to redundant pathways which do not involve Syk. Similarly Syk does not produce significant effects on platelet activation despite its involvement in glycoprotein IV and integrin based signalling. Activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity by natural killer cells is also unaffected despite the involvement of Syk in Fc receptor signalling [A32898].

R406 binds to the adenosine A3 receptor as an antagonist as well as the adenosine and monoamine uptake transporters as an inhibitor [A32899,A32906]. It has also been found to be an inhibitor of UDP glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1, phosphodiesterase PDE5, fatty acid amide hydrolase, 5-lipoxygenase, cathepsin L, and cathepsin S [A32906]. R406 appears to inhibit a wide range of kinases at higher concentrations [A32906]. It is thought that inhibition of some of these targets may be responsible for the increase in blood pressure seen with fostamatinib.","Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK|Adenosine receptor A3|Synaptic

chronic immune thrombocytopenia (itp) in patients who have had insufficient response to previous therapy [fda label].,"the active metabolite of fostamatinib, r406, is an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (syk) [a32899]. it binds reversibly to the atp binding pocket with high affinity (ki = 30nm), inhibiting the kinase activity with an ic50 of 41nm.

syk is a cytosolic protein kinase and part of the signalling cascade which occurs with fc receptors, tcrs, and bcrs [a32898]. it contains two src homology 2 (sh2) domains separated by a linker domain. these sh2 domains bind to tyrosine residues on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif phosphorylated by lyn, another kinase in the cascade. this motif is located on the cytoplasmic regions of several immune receptors including fc receptors, tcrs, bcrs, and natural killer cell receptors. the flexibility provided by the linker enables the protein to bind to many receptor types. inhibition of syk suppresses downstream signal transduction [a32899].

while syk plays a role in some pathways involved in the generation of the oxidative burst by neutrophils or phagocytosis by macrophages, r406 does not have a significant effect on these processes [a32899]. this is likely due to redundant pathways which do not involve syk. similarly syk does not produce significant effects on platelet activation despite its involvement in glycoprotein iv and integrin based signalling. activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity by natural killer cells is also unaffected despite the involvement of syk in fc receptor signalling [a32898].

r406 binds to the adenosine a3 receptor as an antagonist as well as the adenosine and monoamine uptake transporters as an inhibitor [a32899,a32906]. it has also been found to be an inhibitor of udp glucuronosyltransferase ugt1a1, phosphodiesterase pde5, fatty acid amide hydrolase, 5-lipoxygenase, cathepsin l, and cathepsin s [a32906]. r406 appears to inhibit a wide range of kinases at higher concentrations [a32906]. it is thought that inhibition of some of these targets may be responsible for the increase in blood pressure seen with fostamatinib."

DB14487,Zinc acetate,"Zinc can be used for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency/its consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, and slowed wound healing. It is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [L2172].","**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].

Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].

In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].

There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].

Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].

The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32417]. 

In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].

In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32417]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].

The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].","B1 bradykinin receptor|Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase|Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A|Elongation factor 1-alpha

consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, and slowed wound healing. it is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [l2172].","**zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. the catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. for example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. it is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [l2096].

zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [a32419].

in hl-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of a20 mrna, which, via traf pathway, decreases nf-kappab activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-1beta, and il-8 [a32418].

there are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 september 2016 [l2106].

zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of t-helper cells. t-helper 1 (th(1)) cytokines are decreased but t-helper 2 (th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [a32417].

the change of _th(1)_ to _th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. because il-2 production (th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (nk cell) and t cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [a32417]. 

in humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new cd4+ t cells, produced in the thymus. in cell culture studies (hut-78, a th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) activation, phosphorylation of ikappab, and binding of nf-kappab to dna are decreased and this results in decreased th(1) cytokine production [a32417].

in another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [a32417]. in hl-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-8 cytokines and mrna. in such cells, zinc was found to induce a20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited nf-kappab activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. this process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [a32417].
