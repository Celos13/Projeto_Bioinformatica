It is indicated for treating a recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in combination with platinum-based therapy with fluorouracil. It is indicated for recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck progressing after platinum-based therapy.[L30448]

Cetuximab is also indicated for K-Ras wild-type, EGFR-expressing, metastatic colorectal cancer as determined by an FDA-approved test in combination with FOLFIRI, a chemotherapy combination that includes [leucovorin], [fluorouracil], and [irinotecan]; in combination with irinotecan in patients who are refractory to irinotecan-based chemotherapy; or as monotherapy in patients who have failed oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy or who are intolerant to irinotecan.[L30448]

Additionally, cetuximab is also indicated for metastatic colorectal cancer that is BRAF V600E mutation-positive (as determined by an FDA-approved test) in combination with [encorafenib] but only after prior therapy.[L39045]

Cetuximab is not indicated for the treatment of Ras-mutant colorectal cancer or when the results of the Ras mutation tests are unknown.[L30448]","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and a type I receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on both normal and malignant cells. It has been investigated as a therapeutic target for anticancer treatment, as it is often upregulated in cancer types, including head and neck, colon, and rectal cancers.[L30448] When activated by its ligand, EGFR undergoes a conformational change and dimerization to form homodimers or heterodimers with another member of the ErbB family of receptors. Dimerization of EGFR activates the intracellular tyrosine kinase region of EGFR and promotes autophosphorylation, initiating a series of downstream signalling cascades, including cell differentiation, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. This EGFR signalling pathway is often dysregulated in cancer cells, leading to aberrant cell growth and enhanced cell survival.[L31418]

Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the EGFR on both normal and tumour cells to competitively inhibit the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands that are produced by normal and tumour tissue epithelial cells.[A11, L30448] Upon binding to domain III of EGFR - which is the binding site for its growth factor ligands - cetuximab prevents the receptor from adopting an extended conformation and thereby inhibits EGFR activation, as well as phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases (MAPK, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat).[A11, A228078] Inhibition of the EGFR signalling pathway ultimately leads to inhibition of cell cycle progression, cell survival pathways, and tumour cell motility and invasion.[A227963] Cetuximab also induces cell apoptosis and decreases matrix metalloproteinase and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production.[A228078, L30448] _In vitro_, cetuximab was shown to inhibit tumour angiogenesis.[A227978] Binding of cetuximab to EGFR also results in internalization of the antibody-receptor complex, leading to an overall downregulation of EGFR expression.[A227973]

Trastuzumab is indicated as a first-line treatment, in combination with paclitaxel, for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, and as monotherapy in patients who have previously received one or more chemotherapy regimens in the metastatic setting.[L14015] In Europe, trastuzumab can also be used in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer in adult patients and with an aromatase inhibitor in postmenopausal patients.[L49324]

For HER2-positive early breast cancer, the EMA approved trastuzumab as monotherapy following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant), and radiation or following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel. It can also be used in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin or with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant trastuzumab therapy for locally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumors > 2 cm in diameter.[L49324]

Trastuzumab is also indicated, in combination with cisplatin and capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, for the treatment of patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease by the FDA and EMA.[L14015]

Trastuzumab is indicated for subcutaneous administration - in combination with either [hyaluronidase][L14132] or both hyaluronidase and [pertuzumab][L14510] - for the treatment of adults with HER2-positive breast cancers.","Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the HER-2 receptor, a member of the epidermal growth factor receptors which is a photo-oncogene. Over-expressed in breast tumour cells, HER-2 overamplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by forming heterodimers [A121]. The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains [A121]. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression [A121]. Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation [A121], and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation [A121]. Trastuzumab also mediates the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) [A40276] by attracting the immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to tumor sites that overexpress HER-2 [A121]. While the drug alone has a minimal potential to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),[A201902] one study demonstrated increased therapeutic effectiveness and a synergistic effect on uterine serous carcinoma cells _in vitro_ when used in combination with [pertuzumab], which also has minor effects on CDC alone. This study showed that only the combination of both cell-bound antibodies would be sufficient to bind and activate the complement component 1q (C1q) required to initiate the complement cascade reaction.[A201896]

Intrinsic trastuzumab resistance has been noted for some patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer. Mechanisms involving trastuzumab resistance include deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homologue and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the overexpression of other surface receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor [A40276].",Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2,receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbb-2,"for the adjuvant treatment of her2-overexpressing breast cancer, trastuzumab is indicated in several clinical settings: as part of a treatment regimen consisting of doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and either paclitaxel or docetaxel; as part of a treatment regimen with docetaxel and carboplatin; or as monotherapy following multi-modality anthracycline-based therapy.[l14015]

filgrastim is indicated to increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation.[l40714]","neutrophils are critical granulocytes involved in the acute inflammatory response and host defences against bacterial infections.[a245873] they also contribute to long-term adaptive immunity by promoting immediate host immune response and attracting other cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. as neutrophils promote both the initiation and the maintenance of inflammation at sites of infection, suppressed neutrophil responses lead to extreme susceptibility to infection.[a35605] low neutrophil levels, or neutropenia, caused by chronic neutropenia, myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and radiation therapy increases the risk of infection and related events.[a245868] neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy can further progress into febrile neutropenia, which is associated with an elevated risk for life-threatening systemic infections and chemotherapy-associated morbidity and mortality.[a35591]

the production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow are normally regulated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (g-csf), which are major cytokine regulators of neutrophilic granulocytes.[a35605] g-csfs act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors to stimulate the proliferation‚ differentiation‚ and maturation of neutrophil progenitors. g-csf also induces some end-cell functional activation of neutrophils, including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens.[l40714]  filgrastim is a short-acting recombinant g-csf that mimics the biological actions of endogenous g-csf. it also facilitates the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow into the blood to reduce the incidence of infection and manage neutropenia.[a245858, a245868]"

DB00117,Histidine,The actions of supplemental L-histidine are entirely unclear. It may have some immunomodulatory as well as antioxidant activity. L-histidine may be indicated for use in some with rheumatoid arthritis. It is not indicated for treatment of anemia or uremia or for lowering serum cholesterol.,"Since the actions of supplemental L-histidine are unclear, any postulated mechanism is entirely speculative. However, some facts are known about L-histidine and some of its metabolites, such as histamine and trans-urocanic acid, which suggest that supplemental L-histidine may one day be shown to have immunomodulatory and/or antioxidant activities. Low free histidine has been found in the serum of some rheumatoid arthritis patients. Serum concentrations of other amino acids have been found to be normal in these patients. L-histidine is an excellent chelating agent for such metals as copper, iron and zinc. Copper and iron participate in a reaction (Fenton reaction) that generates potent reactive oxygen species that could be destructive to tissues, including joints. L-histidine is the obligate precursor of histamine, which is produced via the decarboxylation of the amino acid. In experimental animals, tissue histamine levels increase as the amount of dietary L-histidine increases. It is likely that this would be the case in humans as well. Histamine is known to possess immunomodulatory and antioxidant activity. Suppressor T cells have H2 receptors, and histamine activates them. Promotion of suppressor T cell activity could be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. Further, histamine has been shown to down-regulate the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, by binding to the H2 receptors on these cells. Decreased reactive oxygen species production by phagocytes could play antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. This latter mechanism is the rationale for the use of histamine itself in several clinical trials studying histamine for the treatment of certain types of cancer and viral diseases. In these trials, down-regulation by histamine of reactive oxygen species formation appears to inhibit the suppression of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, allowing these cells to be more effective in attacking cancer cells and virally infected cells.","Histidine decarboxylase|Histidine--tRNA ligase, cytoplasmic|Sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 3|Histidine ammonia-lyase","histidine decarboxylase|histidine--trna ligase, cytoplasmic|sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 3|histidine ammonia-lyase",the actions of supplemental l-histidine are entirely unclear. it may have some immunomodulatory as well as antioxidant activity. l-histidine may be indicated for use in some with rheumatoid arthritis. it is not indicated for treatment of anemia or uremia or for lowering serum cholesterol.,"since the actions of supplemental l-histidine are unclear, any postulated mechanism is entirely speculative. however, some facts are known about l-histidine and some of its metabolites, such as histamine and trans-urocanic acid, which suggest that supplemental l-histidine may one day be shown to have immunomodulatory and/or antioxidant activities. low free histidine has been found in the serum of some rheumatoid arthritis patients. serum concentrations of other amino acids have been found to be normal in these patients. l-histidine is an excellent chelating agent for such metals as copper, iron and zinc. copper and iron participate in a reaction (fenton reaction) that generates potent reactive oxygen species that could be destructive to tissues, including joints. l-histidine is the obligate precursor of histamine, which is produced via the decarboxylation of the amino acid. in experimental animals, tissue histamine levels increase as the amount of dietary l-histidine increases. it is likely that this would be the case in humans as well. histamine is known to possess immunomodulatory and antioxidant activity. suppressor t cells have h2 receptors, and histamine activates them. promotion of suppressor t cell activity could be beneficial in rheumatoid arthritis. further, histamine has been shown to down-regulate the production of reactive oxygen species in phagocytic cells, such as monocytes, by binding to the h2 receptors on these cells. decreased reactive oxygen species production by phagocytes could play antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles in such diseases as rheumatoid arthritis. this latter mechanism is the rationale for the use of histamine itself in several clinical trials studying histamine for the treatment of certain types of cancer and viral diseases. in these trials, down-regulation by histamine of reactive oxygen species formation appears to inhibit the suppression of natural killer (nk) cells and cytotoxic t lymphocytes, allowing these cells to be more effective in attacking cancer cells and virally infected cells."

Omega-3 fatty acids like ALA and its byproducts can modulate the expression of a number of genes, including those involved with fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. They regulate gene expression through their effects on the activity of transcription factors including NF-kappa B and members of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family.

Also used in conjunction with calcium in the management and prevention of primary or corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis.","The mechanism of action of calcitriol in the treatment of psoriasis is accounted for by their antiproliferative activity for keratinocytes and their stimulation of epidermal cell differentiation. The anticarcinogenic activity of the active form of Calcitriol appears to be correlated with cellular vitamin D receptor (VDR) levels. Vitamin D receptors belong to the superfamily of steroid-hormone zinc-finger receptors. VDRs selectively bind 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimeric complex that interacts with specific DNA sequences known as vitamin D-responsive elements. VDRs are ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptors activate or repress the transcription of target genes upon binding their respective ligands. It is thought that the anticarcinogenic effect of Calcitriol is mediated via VDRs in cancer cells. The immunomodulatory activity of calcitriol is thought to be mediated by vitamin D receptors (VDRs) which are expressed constitutively in monocytes but induced upon activation of T and B lymphocytes. 1,25-(OH)<sub>2</sub>-D3 has also been found to enhance the activity of some vitamin D-receptor positive immune cells and to enhance the sensitivity of certain target cells to various cytokines secreted by immune cells.

A study suggests that calcitriol plays an immunoregulatry role by suppressing the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expression in human Th9, a pro-inflammatory CD4 T cell subset [A175747]. This suppression subsequently leads to repressed expression of BATF, a transcription factor essential for Th9 [A175747].

DB00169,Cholecalciferol,"Cholecalciferol use is indicated for the treatment of specific medical conditions like refractory rickets (or vitamin D resistant rickets), hypoparathyroidism, and familial hypophosphatemia [F4027, F4042].

Concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin D, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin D deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [A176041, A176044, F4051].","Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048].

Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [A243]. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [A223]. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [A223]. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [A223].

Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [A223]. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation [A223, A243]. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [A223, A243].

In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [L5689]. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [L5689]. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [L5689]. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [L5689].

Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene's activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].",Vitamin D3 receptor,vitamin d3 receptor,"cholecalciferol use is indicated for the treatment of specific medical conditions like refractory rickets (or vitamin d resistant rickets), hypoparathyroidism, and familial hypophosphatemia [f4027, f4042].

concurrently, as one of the most commonly utilized forms of vitamin d, cholecalciferol is also very frequently used as a supplement in individuals to maintain sufficient vitamin d levels in the body or to treat vitamin d deficiency, as well as various medical conditions that can be associated directly or indirectly with vitamin d insufficiency like osteoporosis and chronic kidney disease, among others [a176041, a176044, f4051].","most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin d through ordinary dietary intake of vitamin d (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural photochemical conversion of the vitamin d3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin via exposure to sunlight [l5689, f4027, f4042, f4048].

conversely, vitamin d deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin d, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin d receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease [a243]. such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone [a223]. increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus [a223]. this enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions [a223].

ordinarily, while vitamin d3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin d2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. the principal biological function of vitamin d is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet [a223]. at the liver, vitamin d3 or d2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin d and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d in the kidney via further hydroxylation [a223, a243]. this final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining  calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma [a223, a243].

in particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin d receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively [l5689]. furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin d receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kb ligand (or rankl) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kb (nfkb) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts [l5689]. such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels [l5689]. moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys [l5689].

DB00227,Lovastatin,"Lovastatin is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and the need for coronary revascularization procedures in individuals without symptomatic cardiovascular disease, average to moderately elevated total-C and LDL-C, and below average HDL-C. It is indicated as an intervention alternative in individuals presenting dyslipidemia at risk of developing atherosclerotic vascular disease. The administration of this agent should be accompanied by the implementation of a fat and cholesterol-restricted diet.[F4661]

Therapy with lipid-altering agents should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia. Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet for the reduction of elevated total-C and LDL-C levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (Types IIa and IIb2), when the response to diet restricted in saturated fat and cholesterol and to other nonpharmacological measures alone has been inadequate.[F4661,F4664]

Lovastatin is indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce total-C, LDL-C and apolipoprotein B levels in adolescent boys and girls with Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who are at least one year post-menarche, 10 to 17 years of age, with HeFH if after an adequate trial of diet therapy the following findings are present: LDL-C remains greater than 189 mg/dL or LDL-C remains greater than 160 mg/dL and there is a positive family history of premature cardiovascular disease or two or more other CVD risk factors are present in the adolescent patient.

Before administering lovastatin, it is important to rule out the presence of secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia and a lipid profile should be performed.

Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD. Statin-indicated conditions include diabetes mellitus, clinical atherosclerosis (including myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, stable angina, documented coronary artery disease, stroke, trans ischemic attack (TIA), documented carotid disease, peripheral artery disease, and claudication), abdominal aortic aneurysm, chronic kidney disease, and severely elevated LDL-C levels.[A181087, A181406]","Lovastatin is a lactone which is readily hydrolyzed _in vivo_ to the corresponding β-hydroxyacid and strong inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ) to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.[A181421,A174553] At therapeutic lovastatin doses, HMG-CoA reductase is not completely blocked, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to be available. Because the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with lovastatin would not be expected to cause an accumulation of potentially toxic sterols.[F4664]

Lovastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increase hepatic uptake of LDL. Lovastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475]

A significant effect on LDL-C reduction was seen within 2 weeks of initiation of lovastatin, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within 4-6 weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy. Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly at night. When therapy with lovastatin is stopped, total cholesterol has been shown to return to pre-treatment levels.[F4664]

3) Emergency treatment of status epilepticus.[A177955]","The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.

Valproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.[A177991] This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[A457] A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.

It has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).[A457] These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.[A177997]

Valproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[A178000] This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[A178003] Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-α and -ε which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.[A178015] The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[A178018] Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[A178021]

Valproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[A457] Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[A178024] Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.[A14708] Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins.

3) emergency treatment of status epilepticus.[a177955]","the exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it's effects on epilepsy, migraine headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which may contribute to the drug's action.

valproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.[a177991] this inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of gaba transaminase ultimately reducing gaba metabolism and increasing gabaergic neurotransmission. as gaba is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.[a457] a possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on gaba.

it has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (erk).[a457] these effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (mek) and result in the phosphorylation of erk1/2. this activation increases expression of several downstream targets including elk-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, b-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. an additional downstream effect of increased bdnf expression appears to be an increase in gaba<sub>a</sub> receptors which contribute further to increased gabaergic activity.[a177997]

valproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.[a178000] this results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. it is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.[a178003] valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase c proteins (pkc)-α and -ε which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as pkc is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. this is further supported by a similar reduction in pkc with lithium.[a178015] the inhibition of the pkc pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.[a178018] myristoylated alanine-rich c kinase substrate, a pkc substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.[a178021]

valproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.[a457] less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.[a178024] valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-coa synthetase.[a14708] inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-coa, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. it is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.

finally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (hdac) inhibitor.[a178030] hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted dna relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. the scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[a178027] the relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however h3 and h4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.[a178033] histone hyperacetylation at the bdnf gene, increasing bdnf expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[a178036] h3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.[a11814]"

There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.[A177871] Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.[A177871] COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme's active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.

The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.[L6778] At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.[A177880] Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen.

It is distributed by prescription for patients under 17, and over the counter for those above this age.[L7760] This levonorgestrel-only form of contraception is not indicated for regular contraception and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,L7760] It has shown a lower efficacy when it is used off label within 96 hours.[T659]

**Long-term contraception or nonemergency contraception**

In addition to the above indication in emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is combined with other contraceptives in contraceptive formulations designed for regular use, for example with ethinyl estradiol.[L7766] It is used in various hormone-releasing intrauterine devices for long-term contraception ranging for a duration of 3-5 years.[L7778,L7781,L7787] Product labeling for Mirena specifically mentions that it is recommended in women who have had at least 1 child and can be indicated for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 8 years.[L7778,L42950] A subdermal implant is also available for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.[L7823]

**Hormone therapy and off-label uses**

Levonorgestrel is prescribed in combination with estradiol as hormone therapy during menopause to manage vasomotor symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis.[L7805]Off-label, levonorgestrel may be used to treat menorrhagia, endometrial hyperplasia, and endometriosis.[T659]","**Mechanism of action on ovulation**

Oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.[T659]

**Mechanism of action in cervical mucus changes**

Similar to other levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, the intrauterine (IUD) forms of levonorgestrel likely prevent pregnancy by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus, interfering with the movement and survival of sperm, and inducing changes in the endometrium, where a fertilized ovum is usually implanted.[L7778,L7781] Levonorgestrel is reported to alter the consistency of mucus in the cervix, which interferes with sperm migration into the uterus for fertilization. Levonorgestrel is not effective after implantation has occurred.[A181976] 
Interestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception. Over a long-term period, however, levonorgestrel has been proven to thicken cervical mucus.[A181976] The exact mechanism of action of levonorgestrel is not completely understood and remains a topic of controversy and ongoing investigation.[A181976,L7760]

*Effects on implantation**

The effects of levonorgestrel on endometrial receptivity are unclear, and the relevance of this mechanism to the therapeutic efficacy of levonorgestrel is contentious.[A175372,A218666] Prescribing information for levonorgestrel IUDs state that they exert local morphological changes to the endometrium (e.g. stromal pseudodecidualization, glandular atrophy) that may play a role in their contraceptive activity.[L7778,L7781]

**Mechanism of action in hormone therapy**

When combined with estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis, levonorgestrel serves to lower the carcinogenic risk of unopposed estrogen therapy via the inhibition of endometrial proliferation. Unregulated endometrial proliferation sometimes leads to endometrial cancer after estrogen use.[L7808]",Progesterone receptor|3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 1|Estrogen receptor|Androgen receptor|Sex hormone-binding globulin|Glucocorticoid receptor,progesterone receptor|3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 1|estrogen receptor|androgen receptor|sex hormone-binding globulin|glucocorticoid receptor,"**emergency contraception**

2) the management of patients with leukemia, lymphoma and malignancies who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary uric acid levels. Treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued when the potential for overproduction of uric acid is no longer present.

3) the management of patients with recurrent calcium oxalate calculi whose daily uric acid excretion exceeds 800 mg/day in male patients and 750 mg/day in female patients. Therapy in such patients should be carefully assessed initially and reassessed periodically to determine in each case that treatment is beneficial and that the benefits outweigh the risks.","Allopurinol is a structural analog of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine.  After ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (_alloxanthine_) in the liver [T508], which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA label]. 

Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase).  This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations [F3988], which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms. 

Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase).  In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria. By lowering the uric acid concentration in the plasma below its limits of solubility, allopurinol encourages the dissolution of gout tophi. Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney [F3988].",Xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase,xanthine dehydrogenase/oxidase,"allopurinol is indicated in [fda label]:

T<sub>4</sub> is the major hormone secreted from the thyroid gland and is chemically identical to the naturally secreted T<sub>4</sub>: it increases metabolic rate, decreases thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) production from the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, and, in peripheral tissues, is converted to T<sub>3</sub>. Thyroxine is released from its precursor protein thyroglobulin through proteolysis and secreted into the blood where is it then peripherally deiodinated to form triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) which exerts a broad spectrum of stimulatory effects on cell metabolism.

Thyroid hormone increases the metabolic rate of cells of all tissues in the body.

Ligand binding induces a conformational change in the receptor that promotes dissociation of the receptor from Hsp90, dimerization and translocation into the nucleus. This movement into the nucleus allows the receptor to bind to genomic locations based on sequence recognition of the DNA binding domain, also known as the Estrogen Response Elements (EREs).[A178861] 

In bones, endogenous estrogens normally modulate multiple DNA response elements, including the gene-encoding transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3), which is a cytokine embedded in the bone matrix.[T28] TGF-β3 plays an important role in bone remodelling[A178756] by working with other cytokines to induce production of osteoblasts, such as IL-6[A720], and attenuate the activity of osetoclasts. Estrogens typically maintain the bone integrity by inhibiting the cytokines that recruit osteoclasts and oppose the bone-resorbing, Ca2+-mobilizing action of parathyroid hormone. In contrast, estrogens promote osteoblast proliferation, augment the production of TGF-β3 and bone morphogenic proteins, and inhibit apoptosis.[T28] Mimicking the action of endogenous estrogen in bone tissues, raloxifene binds to the estrogen receptor to influence gene transcription through interactions with the estrogen response element (ERE) and a distinct DNA target, the raloxifene response element (RRE).[A722] It occupies the same ER ligand binding site as estrogen.[A724] Upon binding, raloxifene induces a conformational change of the receptor, allowing mediation of direct binding to transcriptional elements by accessory proteins. Increased expression of bone matrix proteins, such as alkaline phosphatase, osteonectin, osteocalcin and collagen may be seen.[A722] The agonistic or antagonistic action of raloxifene depends on the extent of recruitment of coactivators and corepressors to estrogen receptor (ER) target gene promotors.[label] In breast tissues, raloxifene acts as an estrogen receptor antagonist to attenuate the estrogen-dependent proliferative effects of epithelial cell expansion. In addition to the antiproliferative effects, raloxifene prevents the production of cytokines and recruitment of macrophages and lymphocytes into tumor mass.[A178921]",Estrogen receptor|Estrogen receptor beta|Serpin B9|Trefoil factor 1,estrogen receptor|estrogen receptor beta|serpin b9|trefoil factor 1,"indicated for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, as well as prevention and treatment of corticosteroid-induced bone loss.[label]

DB00538,Gadoversetamide,"Gadoversetamide is an MRI contrast agent used for MRI diagnostic procedures to provide increased enhancement and visualization of lesions of the brain, spine and liver, including tumors.","Based on the behavior of protons when placed in a strong magnetic field, which is interpreted and transformed into images by magnetic resonance (MR) instruments. MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain, spinal and hepatic tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoversetamide shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At the recommended dose, the effect is primarily on T1 relaxation time, and produces an increase in signal intensity (brightness). Gadoversetamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that may have a normal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars).

Tretinoin is believed to exert its pharmacological actions by binding to and activating two types of nuclear receptors - retinoic acid receptors (RARs) alpha, beta, and gamma and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). In the human skin, RARs (especially RAR-alpha) form heterodimers with RXR to act as inducible transcription regulators of genes involved in cell differentiation by binding to retinoic acid response elements.[A257724,A258185] Tretinoin binds to RXRs to promote epidermal proliferation. It also blocks the actions of inflammatory mediators, enhancing procollagen production and collagen type I and III formations.[A257474,A257629,A257609,A257699] Some animal and human studies suggest that tretinoin induces the expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), which stimulates the transcription of several types of collagen messenger RNA. Collagen formation curtails further solar UV-induced skin damage and aging processes.[A257699]

Acne is associated with abnormal follicular formation from excessive keratinization of epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes cornified cell detachment and enhances keratinocyte shedding.

Following extensive critique of the WHI results, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years postmenopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease.[A31628] Estrogen for postmenopausal symptoms should always be given with a progestin component due to estrogen's stimulatory effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer over the long-term.","Estrogen is found in the the breast, uterine, ovarian, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain tissues. The main source of estrogen in adult women during the reproductive period of life is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol each day. After menopause, however, the majority of endogenous estrogen is produced by transformation of androstenedione (which is secreted by the adrenal cortex) to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.[L11530] 

Estradiol, however, is considerably more potent than estrone and estriol at the estrogen receptor (ER). As a result, the higher estrone concentration in postmenopausal population, can cause various undesirable effects. These effects may include hot flashes, chills, vaginal dryness, mood swings, irregular menstruation, and chills, in addition to sleep problems.[L11530]

Estradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). It also exerts potent agonism of G Protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is recognized an important regulator of this drug's rapid effects. Once the estrogen receptor has bound to its ligand, it enters the nucleus of the target cell, regulating gene transcription and formation of of messenger RNA. This mRNA makes contact with ribosomes producing specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Agonism of estrogen receptors increases pro-estrogenic effects, leading to the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms of a postmenopausal or low estradiol state.[A31620,L11485,L11497]",Estrogen receptor|Estrogen receptor beta|Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2|Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4|G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1|ATP synthase subunit a|Beclin-1,estrogen receptor|estrogen receptor beta|nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group i member 2|neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-4|g-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1|atp synthase subunit a|beclin-1,"estradiol is indicated in various preparations for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and vulvar and vaginal atrophy due to menopause, for the treatment of hypoestrogenism due to hypogonadism, castration, or primary ovarian failure, and for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis. it is also used for the treatment of breast cancer (only for palliation therapy) in certain men or women with metastatic disease, and for the treatment of androgen-dependent prostate cancer (only for palliation therapy).[l11485,l11494,l11497] it is also used in combination with other hormones as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregnancy (most commonly as [db00977], a synthetic form of estradiol).

DB00789,Gadopentetic acid,"For use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in adults, and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) to visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the brain (intracranial lesions), spine and associated tissues as well as lesions with abnormal vascularity in the head and neck. Also used to facilitate the visualization of lesions with abnormal vascularity in the body (excluding the heart).","Based on the behavior of protons when placed in a strong magnetic field, which is interpreted and transformed into images by magnetic resonance (MR) instruments. MR images are based primarily on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. The proton relaxation effect (PRE) of an unpaired electron is 700 times stronger than that of a proton itself. In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadopentetate dimeglumine shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. In the central nervous system (CNS), gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances visualization of normal tissues that lack a blood-brain barrier, such as the pituitary gland and the meninges. Gadopentetate dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts. Outside the CNS, gadopentetate dimeglumine rapidly reaches equilibrium in the interstitial compartment and enhances signal in all tissues as a function of delivery and size of the interstitial compartment.

DB00853,Temozolomide,Temozolomide is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and for use as maintenance treatment thereafter. It is also indicated for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma in adult patients or adjuvant therapy for adults with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.[L48265],"Glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common and aggressive adult primary brain tumour, accounting for 45.6% of all primary malignant brain tumours. Primarily defined histopathologically by necrosis and microvascular proliferation (WHO grade IV classification), glioblastomas are commonly treated through radiotherapy and concomitant alkylation-based chemotherapy with temozolomide.[A229848] Temozolomide (TMZ) is a small (194 Da) lipophilic alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine class that is stable at acidic pH, allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing, and can cross the blood-brain barrier to affect CNS tumours.[A229853, A229858, L32033, A229893] After absorption, TMZ undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic breakdown at physiological pH to form 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), which then reacts with water to produce 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) and a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation.[A229853] Brain tumours such as glioblastoma typically possess a more alkaline pH than healthy tissue, favouring TMZ activation within tumour tissue.[A229853]

The methyl diazonium cation is highly reactive and methylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine (N7-MeG, 70%), the N3 position of adenine (N3-MeA, 9%), and the O6 position of guanine (O6-MeG, 6%). Although more prevalent, N7-MeG and N3-MeA are rapidly repaired by the base excision repair pathway and are not primary mediators of temozolomide toxicity, although N3-MeA lesions are lethal if not repaired. By comparison, repair of O6-MeG requires action by the suicide enzyme methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes the methyl group to restore guanine. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis.[A229853] As MMR activity is crucial for temozolomide cytotoxicity, cells that have reduced or absent MGMT function and an intact MMR pathway are the most sensitive to temozolomide treatment.[A229853, A229858] Glioblastomas that upregulate MGMT downregulate MMR or alter both are resistant to TMZ, leading to treatment failure.[A229853]

More recently, increased interest has also been shown in the immunomodulatory effects of TMZ, related to its myelosuppressive effects. Counterintuitively, lymphodepletion may enhance the antitumour effects of cellular immunotherapy and improve the dynamics of memory cells by altering tumour-specific versus tumour-tolerant populations. The depletion of tumour-localized immunosuppressive T<sub>reg</sub> cells may contribute to an improved response to immunotherapy. Hence, TMZ treatment may also form the backbone of immunotherapy strategies against glioblastoma in the future.[A229873]",DNA,dna,temozolomide is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma concomitantly with radiotherapy and for use as maintenance treatment thereafter. it is also indicated for the treatment of refractory anaplastic astrocytoma in adult patients or adjuvant therapy for adults with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma.[l48265],"glioblastoma (glioblastoma multiforme) is the most common and aggressive adult primary brain tumour, accounting for 45.6% of all primary malignant brain tumours. primarily defined histopathologically by necrosis and microvascular proliferation (who grade iv classification), glioblastomas are commonly treated through radiotherapy and concomitant alkylation-based chemotherapy with temozolomide.[a229848] temozolomide (tmz) is a small (194 da) lipophilic alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine class that is stable at acidic ph, allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing, and can cross the blood-brain barrier to affect cns tumours.[a229853, a229858, l32033, a229893] after absorption, tmz undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic breakdown at physiological ph to form 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (mtic), which then reacts with water to produce 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (aic) and a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation.[a229853] brain tumours such as glioblastoma typically possess a more alkaline ph than healthy tissue, favouring tmz activation within tumour tissue.[a229853]

Topical sirolimus is indicated for the treatment of facial angiofibroma associated with tuberous sclerosis in adults and pediatric patients six years of age and older.[L41489]","Sirolimus works by inhibiting T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation stimulated by antigens and cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, and IL-15. In target cells, sirolimus binds to the cytoplasmic receptor FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12), an immunophilin, to form an immunosuppressive complex. FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),[A1321, L19809] which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis.[A1320, A1321] mTOR regulates the downstream signalling pathways involved in cell survival, such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway.[A1320] Inhibition of mTOR leads to the suppression of cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, thus the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle is inhibited. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. _In vitro_, sirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors inhibit the production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability.[L19809] 

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a disorder that primarily affects the lungs. It is characterized by lung tissue infiltration, unregulated alveolar smooth muscle proliferation, and cystic destruction of parenchyma. Although infrequent, it occurs as a symptomatic pulmonary complication in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in TSC genes.[A242437] Loss of functional TSC gene leads to the aberrant activation of the mTOR signalling pathway, resulting in cellular proliferation and release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus inhibits the activated mTOR pathway and proliferation of alveolar smooth muscle cell proliferation.[L19809]",Serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR,serine/threonine-protein kinase mtor,"sirolimus is indicated for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in patients aged 13 years or older receiving renal transplants. in patients at low-to moderate-immunologic risk, it is recommended that sirolimus be used initially in a regimen with [cyclosporine] and corticosteroids; cyclosporine should be withdrawn two to four months after transplantation. in patients at high-immunologic risk (defined as black recipients and/or repeat renal transplant recipients who lost a previous allograft for immunologic reason and/or patients with high panel-reactive antibodies [pra; peak pra level > 80%]), it is recommended that sirolimus be used in combination with cyclosporine and corticosteroids for the first year following transplantation.[l19809]

Covalent binding to DNA methyltransferase results in DNA hypomethylation and prevents DNA synthesis.[A1412] On the other hand, the incorporation of azacitidine into RNA and DNA leads to cytotoxicity as follows: Following cellular uptake, azacitidine is phosphorylated by uridine-cytidine kinase to form 5-azacytidine monophosphate.

However, the reports of various studies in rat and human tissue cultures lend support to the hypothesis that hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis, by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein. Hydroxyurea probably acts by decreasing the rate of conversion of ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides.

Three mechanisms have been postulated for the potentiation of the therapeutic effects of irradiation by hydroxyurea on squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinomas of the head and neck.

It binds to melatonin receptor type 1A, which then acts on adenylate cylcase and the inhibition of a cAMP signal transduction pathway. Melatonin not only inhibits adenylate cyclase, but it also activates phosphilpase C. This potentiates the release of arachidonate. By binding to melatonin receptors 1 and 2, the downstream signallling cascades have various effects in the body. The melatonin receptors are G protein-coupled receptors and are expressed in various tissues of the body. There are two subtypes of the receptor in humans, melatonin receptor 1 (MT1) and melatonin receptor 2 (MT2). Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists, on market or in clinical trials, all bind to and activate both receptor types.The binding of the agonists to the receptors has been investigated for over two decades or since 1986. It is somewhat known, but still not fully understood. When melatonin receptor agonists bind to and activate their receptors it causes numerous physiological processes.

Has also been used for the prevention of acute and chronic rejection in recipients of solid organ trasnplants and is designated by the FDA as an orphan drug for this use.,"Leflunomide is a prodrug that is rapidly and almost completely metabolized following oral administration to its pharmacologically active metabolite, A77 1726. This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an α/β-barrel domain containing the active site and an α-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic.

DB01101,Capecitabine,"Capecitabine is indicated as treatment for a variety of cancer types. For colorectal cancer, capecitabine is indicated as a single agent or a component of a combination chemotherapy regiment for the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer and treatment unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. It can also be used as a part of a combination chemotherapy perioperative treatment of adult locally advanced rectal cancer.[L44657] For breast cancer, capecitabine is indicated for advanced or metastatic breast cancer as a single agent if an anthracycline- or taxane-containing chemotherapy is not indicated or as a regimen with docetaxel after disease progression on prior anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.[L44657] For gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, capecitabine is indicated as a component of a combination chemotherapy treatment for the treatment of adult unresectable or metastatic gastric, esophageal, or GEJ cancer or adult HER2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease.[L44657] Finally, for pancreatic cancer, capecitabine is indicated as adjuvant treatment for adult pancreatic adenocarcinoma as a component of a combination chemotherapy regimen.[L44657]","Capecitabine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil in vivo by carboxylesterases, cytidine deaminase, and thymidine phosphorylase/uridine phosphorylase sequentially.[L44657,A256027,A256142,A256147,A32078] 5-fluorouracil is further metabolized through a series of enzymatic reactions into 3 main active metabolites: 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (5-FUTP), 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine monophosphate (5-FdUMP), and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (5-FdUTP).[A256062,A256027,A256077]. These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH<sub>2</sub>THF), bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex.[L44657] TS is an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).[A256152,A256077] Under normal physiological conditions, dUMP binds to TS first before CH<sub>2</sub>THF, followed by a 1,4 or Michael addition from the pyrimidine C (6)atom to the Cys146 nucleophile.[A256152,A256157] If correctly positioned, dUMP, CH<sub>2</sub>THF, and TS would form a ternary complex to facilitate the donation of the methyl group from CH<sub>2</sub>THF to dUMP.[A256152] However, the substitution of dUMP with FdUMP results in a new time-dependent TS–FdUMP–CH2THF complex. Since the fluorine group prevents dissociation of FdUMP from the pyrimidine ring, the whole complex is rendered irreversibly deactivated, terming this reaction ""suicide inhibition"".[A256152,A256162] TS inhibition prevents the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, depleting the pool of dTMP that could be phosphorylated into dTTP to be incorporated as DNA nucleotides. This disrupts the nucleotides balance, particularly the the ATP/dTTP ratio, thus impairing DNA synthesis and repair and causing apoptosis.[A256167,A256152] 

5-FdUMP can also be phosphorylated into 5-FdUTP, further increasing the pool of dUTP base to potentially overwhelm the activity of dUTPase.[A256177] Coupled with the decrease in dTTP, 5-FdUMP, and 5-FdUTP increase the probability of mistakenly incorporating a uracil base into DNA strands in place of thymine. Although this mistake can often be resolved by the nucleotide excision repair enzyme uracil-DNA-glycosylase (UDG), the high (F)dUTP/dTTP ratio would result in re-incorporation of uracil into DNA, leading to a futile cycle of misincorporation, excision, and repair.[A256172,A841] Repeated base excision repair can result in abasic sites, which can lead to DNA mutagenesis and thus protein miscoding, replication forks collapse, and DNA fragmentation through single or double strand breaks [A256177,A256182,A256187,A256192] 

However, several reports have found that the incorporation of uracil in genomic DNA does not significantly affect the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, suggesting that the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU is dominated by the perturbation of RNA through 5-FUTP.[A256197,A256202] Similar to 5-dFUTP, 5-FUTP can be mistakenly incorporated into RNA in place of regular UTP and disrupt regular RNA biology through various mechanisms. 5-FUTP can be incorporated into the spliceosomal U2 snRNA at pseudouridylated sites to prevent further pseudouridylation and thus pre-mrNA splicing. 5-FUTP can also change the structure of U4 and U6 snRNA and reduce the turnover rate of U1 snrNA once incorporated.[A256207] For tRNA, 5-FUTP can affect tRNA's post-transcriptional RNA modifications activity, particularly by inhbiting pseudouridine synthase through formation of covalent complex.[A256212,A256217] Recently, the effect of 5-FUTP on miRNAs and lncRNA was also observed through profound changes in expression, although the precise mechanism is still unknown.[A256222,A256227,A256232]

Although the main mechanism of 5-FU cytotoxicity was thought to be attributed to DNA damages, recent reports have shown that the majority of 5-FU pharmacological action is mediated through RNA, since 5-FU is accumulated ~3000- to 15 000-fold more in RNA compared to that of DNA.[A256237]",Thymidylate synthase|DNA|RNA|Thymidylate synthase,thymidylate synthase|dna|rna|thymidylate synthase,"capecitabine is indicated as treatment for a variety of cancer types. for colorectal cancer, capecitabine is indicated as a single agent or a component of a combination chemotherapy regiment for the adjuvant treatment of stage iii colon cancer and treatment unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer. it can also be used as a part of a combination chemotherapy perioperative treatment of adult locally advanced rectal cancer.[l44657] for breast cancer, capecitabine is indicated for advanced or metastatic breast cancer as a single agent if an anthracycline- or taxane-containing chemotherapy is not indicated or as a regimen with docetaxel after disease progression on prior anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.[l44657] for gastric, esophageal, or gastroesophageal junction (gej) cancer, capecitabine is indicated as a component of a combination chemotherapy treatment for the treatment of adult unresectable or metastatic gastric, esophageal, or gej cancer or adult her2-overexpressing metastatic gastric or gej adenocarcinoma who have not received prior treatment for metastatic disease.[l44657] finally, for pancreatic cancer, capecitabine is indicated as adjuvant treatment for adult pancreatic adenocarcinoma as a component of a combination chemotherapy regimen.[l44657]","capecitabine is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil in vivo by carboxylesterases, cytidine deaminase, and thymidine phosphorylase/uridine phosphorylase sequentially.[l44657,a256027,a256142,a256147,a32078] 5-fluorouracil is further metabolized through a series of enzymatic reactions into 3 main active metabolites: 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (5-futp), 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine monophosphate (5-fdump), and 5-fluorodeoxyuridine triphosphate (5-fdutp).[a256062,a256027,a256077]. these metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. first, fdump and the folate cofactor, n5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (ch<sub>2</sub>thf), bind to thymidylate synthase (ts) to form a covalently bound ternary complex.[l44657] ts is an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dump) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dtmp).[a256152,a256077] under normal physiological conditions, dump binds to ts first before ch<sub>2</sub>thf, followed by a 1,4 or michael addition from the pyrimidine c (6)atom to the cys146 nucleophile.[a256152,a256157] if correctly positioned, dump, ch<sub>2</sub>thf, and ts would form a ternary complex to facilitate the donation of the methyl group from ch<sub>2</sub>thf to dump.[a256152] however, the substitution of dump with fdump results in a new time-dependent ts–fdump–ch2thf complex. since the fluorine group prevents dissociation of fdump from the pyrimidine ring, the whole complex is rendered irreversibly deactivated, terming this reaction ""suicide inhibition"".[a256152,a256162] ts inhibition prevents the conversion of dump to dtmp, depleting the pool of dtmp that could be phosphorylated into dttp to be incorporated as dna nucleotides. this disrupts the nucleotides balance, particularly the the atp/dttp ratio, thus impairing dna synthesis and repair and causing apoptosis.[a256167,a256152]

Finasteride is also indicated for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia, hereditary alopecia, or common male baldness) in male patients.[L6235]","Finasteride acts as a competitive and specific inhibitor of Type II 5α-reductase, a nuclear-bound steroid intracellular enzyme primarily located in the prostatic stromal cell that converts the androgen testosterone into the more active metabolite, 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT).[A2132] DHT is considered to be the primary androgen playing a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.[A178270] DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone[T28] and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.[A178279] Responsible for the production of DHT together with type I 5α-reductase, the type II 5α-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver.[L6235] Although finasteride is 100-fold more selective for type II 5α-reductase than for the type I isoenzyme,[A178183] chronic treatment with this drug may have some effect on type I 5α-reductase, which is predominantly expressed in sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. It is proposed that the type I 5α-reductase and type II 5α-reductase is responsible for the production of one-third and two-thirds of circulating DHT, respectively. 

The mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II 5α-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzyme _in vitro_ and _in vivo_.[L10565] Finasteride works selectively, where it preferentially displays a 100-fold selectivity for the human Type II 5α-reductase over type I enzyme.[L6235] Inhibition of Type II 5α-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concentrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately 20-30% after 6-24 months of continued therapy). It is suggested that increased levels of DHT can lead to potentiated transcription of prostaglandin D2, which promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.[A178189] In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss. Another study suggests that finasteride may work to reduce bleeding of prostatic origin by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the prostate, leading to atrophy and programmed cell death.[A178183] This may bestow the drug therapeutic benefits in patients idiopathic prostatic bleeding, bleeding during anticoagulation, or bleeding after instrumentation.[A178183]",3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 2|Polyprenal reductase|3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 1|Aldo-keto reductase family 1 member D1,3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 2|polyprenal reductase|3-oxo-5-alpha-steroid 4-dehydrogenase 1|aldo-keto reductase family 1 member d1,"finasteride is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) in men with an enlarged prostate to improve symptoms, reduce the risk of acute urinary retention, and reduce the risk of the need for surgery including transurethral resection of the prostate (turp) and prostatectomy.[l10565] a combination product with [tadalafil] is also used for the symptomatic treatment of bph for up to 26 weeks.[l39439]

DB01253,Ergometrine,Used to treat postpartum haemorrhage and postabortion haemorrhage in patients with uterine atony.,"Ergonovine directly stimulates the uterine muscle to increase force and frequency of contractions. With usual doses, these contractions precede periods of relaxation; with larger doses, basal uterine tone is elevated and these relaxation periods will be decreased. Contraction of the uterine wall around bleeding vessels at the placental site produces hemostasis. Ergonovine also induces cervical contractions. The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregnancy. The oxytocic actions of ergonovine are greater than its vascular effects.

DB01593,Zinc,"Zinc can be used for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency/its consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, and slowed wound healing. It is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [L2172].","**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].

Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].

In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].

There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].

Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].

The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32424]. 

In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].

In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32424]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].

The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].","B1 bradykinin receptor|Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase|Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A|Elongation factor 1-alpha

consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, and slowed wound healing. it is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [l2172].","**zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. the catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. for example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. it is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [l2096].

zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [a32419].

in hl-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of a20 mrna, which, via traf pathway, decreases nf-kappab activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-1beta, and il-8 [a32418].

there are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 september 2016 [l2106].

zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of t-helper cells. t-helper 1 (th(1)) cytokines are decreased but t-helper 2 (th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [a32417].

the change of _th(1)_ to _th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. because il-2 production (th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (nk cell) and t cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [a32424]. 

in humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new cd4+ t cells, produced in the thymus. in cell culture studies (hut-78, a th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) activation, phosphorylation of ikappab, and binding of nf-kappab to dna are decreased and this results in decreased th(1) cytokine production [a32417].

in another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [a32424]. in hl-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-8 cytokines and mrna. in such cells, zinc was found to induce a20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited nf-kappab activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. this process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [a32417].

the exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. however, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce p. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of p. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [l2102]."

Nevertheless, a great variety of propionic acid derivatives exist as separate pharmaceuticals, each with their own unique therapeutic categories, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics.","The metabolic fate of propionates varies in different microorganisms [L2722].

Still others can convert propionic acid to B-alanine or directly to CO2 [L2722]. Whatever the case, the inhibiting effect for microbials is likely related to competition with acetate in the acetokinase system, to the blockage of pyruvate conversion to acetyl-coenzyme A and to interference with B-alanine in pantothenic acid syntheses [L2722].

In various in vitro assays, thymosin alpha 1 has been shown to promote T-cell differentiation and maturation; for example, CD4+, CD8+, and CD3+ cells have all been shown to be increased. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to increase production of IFN-g, IL-2, IL-3, and expression of IL-2 receptor following activation by mitogens or antigens, increase NK cell activity, increase production of migratory inhibitory factor (MIF), and increase antibody response to T-cell dependent antigens. Thymosin alpha 1 has also been shown to antagonize dexamethasone-induced apoptosis of thymocytes in vitro. In vivo administration of thymosin alpha 1 to animals immunosuppressed by chemotherapy, tumor burden, or irradiation showed that thymosin alpha 1 protects against cytotoxic damage to bone marrow, tumor progression and opportunistic infections, thereby increasing survival time and number of survivors.

The biological activity of GROs results from their binding to specific cellular proteins as aptamers. One important target protein of GROs has been previously identified as nucleolin, a multifunctional protein expressed at high levels by cancer cells. AGRO100 also associates with nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) essential modulator (NEMO), which is a regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of {kappa}B (I{kappa}B) kinase (IKK) complex, and also called IKK{gamma}. In the classic NF-{kappa}B pathway, the IKK complex is required for phosphorylation of I{kappa}B{alpha} and subsequent activation of the transcription factor NF-{kappa}B. Research shows that treatment of cancer cells with AGRO100 inhibits IKK activity and reduces phosphorylation of I{kappa}B{alpha} in response to tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} stimulation. It also shows that AGRO100 blocks both tumor necrosis factor-{alpha}-induced and constitutive NF-{kappa}B activity in human cancer cell lines derived from cervical, prostate, breast, and lung carcinomas. In addition, in AGRO100-treated cancer cells, NEMO is coprecipitated by nucleolin, indicating that both proteins are present in the same complex. Studies suggest that abrogation of NF-{kappa}B activity may contribute to the anticancer effects of AGRO100 and that nucleolin may play a previously unknown role in regulating the NF-{kappa}B pathway.

DB05112,AP5280,Investigated for use/treatment in solid tumors.,"AP5280 was designed to take advantage of two independent mechanisms for attaining selectivity. The first of these is the enhanced permeability and retention effect by which high molecular weight polymers passively accumulate to high levels in tumors, and the second is the increased level of expression of proteases capable of cleaving the peptide linker between the polymer and the cytotoxic moiety that is characteristic of many tumors.
AP5280 is a chemotherapeutic agent that we believe has the potential to have significantly superior effectiveness in treating numerous cancers compared to platinum compounds currently in use. AP5280 seeks to achieve this goal by attaching a large polymer to a small platinum molecule. This method exploits the usually leaky or hyperpermeable nature of the cells that line the walls of blood vessels that
feed tumors by allowing the large AP5280 molecule to enter the tumor in preference to other tissue, which do not have leaky or hyperpermeable blood vessels. In addition, the capillary/lymphatic drainage system of tumors is not well developed and limited, so the drug gets trapped in the
tumor. This dual effect is called enhanced permeability and retention, or EPR. In addition, the polymer is designed to shield the platinum from interactions with normal cells while the drug circulates within the body, thereby reducing toxicity. The proposed mechanism of how AP5280 is taken up by tumor cells bypasses known membrane-associated mechanisms

DB05502,AG-858,Investigated for use/treatment in leukemia (myeloid).,"Under normal conditions, heat shock proteins are not found outside the cell. But if a cancerous or infected cell has become so sick that it dies and its membrane bursts, all of the cell’s contents spill out, including heat shock proteins that are bound to peptides. These extracellular HSPs send a very strong ‘dange r signal’ to the immune system, instructing it to destroy the other diseased cells. This is how it works:

    * A sick cell dies and ruptures, spilling out the HSP-peptide complexes.
    * These extracellular complexes of HSPs and peptides are detected by circulating immune system cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). These APCs include cells called macrophages and dendritic cells.
    * The HSP complexes bind the CD91 receptor on the APC cell surface. The APC can then take in the HSP complexes.
    * Once the APCs have taken in the HSP complexes, they travel to the lymph nodes, which are clusters of immune system tissue that are distributed throughout the body.
    * In the lymph nodes, the APCs take the peptides that were associated with the HSPs and re-present them on the APC cell surface. These peptides are antigenic — meaning that they can stimulate an immune response.
    * In the lymph nodes, specialized immune cells called T cells ‘see’ these peptides and are then programmed to seek out cells bearing these specific, abnormal peptides.

CS is most commonly caused by an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (ACTH-dependent CS) but may also be caused by an adrenal adenoma, adrenal carcinoma, or adrenal hyperplasia (ACTH-independent CS).

During mitosis, a cell aligns duplicate copies of its DNA along a mitotic spindle and subdivides itself through a process called cytokinesis, creating two identical daughter cells. This process is often poorly regulated in cancer, leading to rapid proliferation and tissue growth. Aurora kinases (A, B, and C) play important, though differentiated, roles in mitosis. Aurora A controls the formation of the spindle assembly, while Aurora B ensures that the DNA is appropriately aligned and that cytokinesis proceeds successfully. Less is known about Aurora C, though it is thought to serve many of the same functions as Aurora B.

DB06193,Pixantrone,"Currently in Phase III investigation for treatment of relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. Presently, no standard therapy exists for patients with relapsed or refractory NHL. [2] After first line therapy has been initiated, most patients have received their lifetime limit of doxorubicin and further use of anthracyclines may potentially lead to anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). Pixantrone is an attractive alternative as a second line agent, due to its lack of cardiac toxicity. [2] 

The phase III trial, PIX-R, is ongoing and will compare pixantrone multidrug therapy with an equivalent regimen in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (the most common type of NHL).

Previous study results have also suggested the possibility that pixantrone may be safe and effective in doxorubicin naive patients. In myocardial strips which are doxorubicin naive, pixantrone is taken up to a higher degree than in myocardial strips which are doxorubicin exposed, and once absorbed exhibits redox inactivity. [3] 

Pixantrone dimaleate has also been investigated as a treatment for acute myelogenous leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, metastatic breast cancer, low grade small lymphocytic lymphomas and general metastatic cancers.","Pixantrone is an aza-anthracenedione which acts as a DNA intercalator. By intercalating between DNA, with modest affinity, it stimulates DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II. (Pixantrone acts as a poison to topoisomerase II by stabilizing protein-DNA complexes which are usually transient, giving rise to double stranded DNA breaks.)
However, pixantrone is believed to have additional mechanisms of action as its potency does not correlate to the degree of double stranded DNA breaks observed. It has been postulated that this second mechanism may be pixantrone-DNA adduct formation. [1]  

It is important to note that the formation of a pixtantrone-DNA adduct requires pixantrone activation by formaldehyde. Formadehyde may be generated in vitro by hydrogen peroxide, and is derived by various sources in biological systems. It is present in low levels as a result of normal metabolism, and may be present in elevated levels in some haematolgical malignancies. [1] The formation of pixantrone-DNA adducts is thus feasible, and it is believed that a long pixantrone-DNA adduct half life has the potential to maximize DNA damage. It may do so by enhancing the disruption of DNA replication and transcription, and potentially by encourage apoptosis. [1]

In explanation of pixantrones lack of cardiotoxicity, it has been elucidated that pixantrone is structurally similar to mitoxantrone; however, instead of a 5,8-dihydroxyphenyl ring (thought to be responsible for cardiotoxicity) it has a nitrogen heteroatom. This nitrogen heteroatom helps to create additional hydrogen bonding sites amd increases pixantrone interaction with DNA and topoisomerase II. [2] 

Pixantrone's lack of a hydroquinone is believed to render it resistant to one electron reduction. In contrast, doxorubicin - which contains a hydroquinone - experiences one electron redox cycling and ROS formation via NADH dehydrogenase. [3] Pixantrone also does not bind iron, and thus does not produce ROS by redox cycling between oxidative states of iron, as other anthracyclines do. [2]

The first line agent doxorubicin is cardiotoxic, in part, due to its ability to redox activate the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, and form a long-lived secondary alcohol metabolite: doxorubicinol. [3] Clearance of doxorubicin from myocardial tissue is incomplete, and it can be found months or years after the last administration. [3] In doxorubicin treated ex vivo cardiac strips, pixantrone formed an N-dealkylated product that inhibited metabolism of residual doxorubicin into doxorubicinol. Additionally, in ex vivo human myocardial strips (doxorubicin naive, and doxorubicin pretreated) pixantrone showed high cardiac uptake without formation of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide. Pixantrones lack of cardiotoxicity is thus attributed to its redox inactivity and inhibition of doxorubicinol formation.

DB06263,Amrubicin,Investigated for use/treatment in lung cancer [A4138].,"As an anthracycline, amrubicin has antimitotic and cytotoxic activity through a variety of mechanisms of action. Amrubicin is found to form complexes with DNA via intercalation between base pairs, and it inhibits topoisomerase II enzyme activity by stabilizing the DNA-topoisomerase II complex, which prevents the re-ligation portion of the ligation-religation reaction that topoisomerase II normally catalyzes [L1710].

Topoisomerase II is an enzyme located in the nucleus that regulates DNA structure through double-strand breakage and re-ligation, therefore modulating DNA replication and transcription. Inhibition of the enzyme leads to inhibition of DNA replication and halt cell growth with an arrest of the cell cycle occurring at the G2/M phase. The mechanism by which amrubicin inhibits DNA topoisomerase II is believed to be through stabilization of the cleavable DNA–topo II complex, ending in re-ligation failure and DNA strand breakage [L1710, A4138]. 

DNA damage triggers activation of caspase-3 and -7 and cleavage of the enzyme PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase), leading to apoptosis and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Amrubicin, like all anthracyclines, intercalates into DNA and produces reactive oxygen free radicals via interaction with NADPH, which causes cell damage [L1710].

DB06328,Methoxyamine,Investigated for use/treatment in cancer/tumors (unspecified).,"Methoyxamine is investigated for use as an adjunct to alkylating agents, reverse resistance to chemotherapy, and enhancing radiation therapy.  
Methoxyamine’s proposed mechanism of action is through blocking of the abasic sites (apurinic/apyrimidinic - AP sites) created by the cleavage of base excision repair (BER) glycoslyates. DNA alkylating agents cause cell death through excessive DNA damage by adduct formation. The human mechanism for DNA repair is very efficient and cancer therapeutics which use this mechanism are often ineffective due to resistance by efficient repair mechanisms such as base excision repair (BER). Alkylating agents such as tezmozolomide form methylated DNA adducts such as O6-methylguanine (O6mG), 7-methylguanine (N7mG) and 3-methyladenine (N3mA). O6mG is a cytotoxic and genotoxic adduct which is repaired by O6-methylguanine DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT). O6mG’s cytotoxicity is due to the mismatch repair mechanism (MMR), but cell induced defects in this repair pathway can lead to drug resistance. The N7mG (dominant lesions caused by methylating agents) and N3mA adducts are both repaired by the BER mechanism. Methoxyamine disrupts the BER pathway, increasing the amount of cytotoxic adducts, which results in cell death. Methoxyamine inhibits BER by stabilizing the AP sites created by cleavage of BER glysosylates, forming MX-AP lesions. 

Methoxyamine may be an effective adjunct to iododeoxyuridine(IUdR) induced radiosensitization and radiation treatment. IUdR is a halogenated pyrimidine which is incorporated into cellular DNA instead of thymidine, which enhances radiotumor sensitivity. Methoxyamine is proposed to have a dual action in this treatment as it alters cell cycle kinetics as well as prevents repair of DNA by BER, allowing increased sensitivity of tumor cells to DNA damage by radiation therapy. The efficiency of cell cycle repair has been shown to be cell cycle dependent, with the G1 phase being second most sensitive to ionizing radiation (the mitotic, M, phase is the most sensitive). Methoxyamine increases the amount of protein 53 (P53) and protein Rb (pRB), senescence factors which cause the cell to remain in the G1 phase. Methoxyamine also creates a stringent checkpoint at the G1/S boundary as well as an insufficient checkpoint at the G2 stage, preventing cells from going into the S phase. The increased number of G1 cells makes methoxyamine treated tumors more susceptible to ionizing radiation. 

The temozolomide and methoxyamine created lesion MX-AP not only disrupts the BER pathway but inhibits topoisomerase II alpha (topo II), an enzyme necessary for DNA replication, recombination and chromosome segregation. MX-AP sites block DNA replication and interfere with choromosome splitting. It is currently uncertain how what the interaction between topoisomerase II and methoxyamine causes cytotoxicity, but several mechanisms have been proposed, such as MX-AP sites binding to topo II, thus reducing their functionality by forming a toxic complex.",DNA,dna,investigated for use/treatment in cancer/tumors (unspecified).,"methoyxamine is investigated for use as an adjunct to alkylating agents, reverse resistance to chemotherapy, and enhancing radiation therapy.

methoxyamine may be an effective adjunct to iododeoxyuridine(iudr) induced radiosensitization and radiation treatment. iudr is a halogenated pyrimidine which is incorporated into cellular dna instead of thymidine, which enhances radiotumor sensitivity. methoxyamine is proposed to have a dual action in this treatment as it alters cell cycle kinetics as well as prevents repair of dna by ber, allowing increased sensitivity of tumor cells to dna damage by radiation therapy. the efficiency of cell cycle repair has been shown to be cell cycle dependent, with the g1 phase being second most sensitive to ionizing radiation (the mitotic, m, phase is the most sensitive). methoxyamine increases the amount of protein 53 (p53) and protein rb (prb), senescence factors which cause the cell to remain in the g1 phase. methoxyamine also creates a stringent checkpoint at the g1/s boundary as well as an insufficient checkpoint at the g2 stage, preventing cells from going into the s phase. the increased number of g1 cells makes methoxyamine treated tumors more susceptible to ionizing radiation. 

the temozolomide and methoxyamine created lesion mx-ap not only disrupts the ber pathway but inhibits topoisomerase ii alpha (topo ii), an enzyme necessary for dna replication, recombination and chromosome segregation. mx-ap sites block dna replication and interfere with choromosome splitting. it is currently uncertain how what the interaction between topoisomerase ii and methoxyamine causes cytotoxicity, but several mechanisms have been proposed, such as mx-ap sites binding to topo ii, thus reducing their functionality by forming a toxic complex."

The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA.

DB06607,Catumaxomab,For use in the management of malignant ascites tumours via intraperitoneal infusion where standard therapy is not available or feasible [FDA Label].,"Catumaxomab contains epitopes for human CD3 and human epithelial cell adehesion molecule. It also has an intact immunoglobulin gamma constant region allowing it to bind to Fcγ I, IIa, and III receptors [FDA Label, A31531]. By binding to CD3 on killer T cells, EpCAM on cancer cells, and Fcγ receptors on accessory immune cells like macrophages and NK cells, Catumaxomab brings immune cells into close proximity to EpCAM positive cancer cells. As a functional antibody, Catumaxomab also stimulates bound NK cells to release cytotoxic mediators like granzyme or bound macrophages to phagocytose the cancer cell. Phagocytosed cancer cells can be processed and have their antigens presented on major histocompatibililty complex II to activate helper T cells and contribute to humoural immunity and activation of killer T cells against EpCAM postive cancer cells.

Upon binding of cytokines and growth factors, JAKs are activated, undergoing cross-phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation. This process also reveals selective binding sites for STATs, which are DNA-binding proteins that also bind to the cytoplasmic region of cytokine or growth factor receptors. Activated JAKs and STATs translocate to the nucleus as transcription factors to regulate gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB).[A229938] They also activate downstream pathways that promote erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic development.[A229703] 

The molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms is not fully understood; however, JAK2 is constitutively activated and the JAK-STAT signalling pathway becomes deregulated and aberrant.[A7450, A229938] Ruxolitinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of JAK2 and JAK1, with some affinity against JAK3 and TYK2. Anticancer effects of ruxolitinib are attributed to its inhibition of JAKs and JAK-mediated phosphorylation of STAT3.[L31938] By downregulating the JAK-STAT pathway, ruxolitinib inhibits myeloproliferation and suppresses the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α.[A229703] 

Activated JAKs are also implicated in graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), which is a severe immune complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation GVHD is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially for patients who do not respond well to corticosteroid therapy. Activated JAKS stimulate T-effector cell responses, leading to increased proliferation of effector T cells and heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

the molecular pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms is not fully understood; however, jak2 is constitutively activated and the jak-stat signalling pathway becomes deregulated and aberrant.[a7450, a229938] ruxolitinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of jak2 and jak1, with some affinity against jak3 and tyk2. anticancer effects of ruxolitinib are attributed to its inhibition of jaks and jak-mediated phosphorylation of stat3.[l31938] by downregulating the jak-stat pathway, ruxolitinib inhibits myeloproliferation and suppresses the plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-6 and tnf-α.[a229703] 

activated jaks are also implicated in graft-versus-host-disease (gvhd), which is a severe immune complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation gvhd is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, especially for patients who do not respond well to corticosteroid therapy. activated jaks stimulate t-effector cell responses, leading to increased proliferation of effector t cells and heightened production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. by blocking jak1 and jak2, ruxolitinib inhibits donor t-cell expansion and suppresses pro-inflammatory responses.[a229913]"

2) as adjunctive analgesic treatment in adult patients with advanced cancer who experience moderate to severe pain during the highest tolerated dose of strong opioid therapy for persistent background pain [L886].","The exact mechanism of action of CBD and THC is not currently fully understood. However, it is known that CBD acts on cannabinoid (CB) receptors of the endocannabinoid system, which are found in numerous areas of the body, including the peripheral and central nervous systems, including the brain. The endocannabinoid system regulates many physiological responses of the body including pain, memory, appetite, and mood. More specifically, CB1 receptors can be found within the pain pathways of the brain and spinal cord where they may affect CBD-induced analgesia and anxiolysis, and CB2 receptors have an effect on immune cells, where they may affect CBD-induced anti-inflammatory processes. 

CBD has been shown to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor, the most abundant G-Protein Coupled Receptor (GPCR) in the body [A32469]. Allosteric regulation of a receptor is achieved through the modulation of the activity of a receptor on a functionally distinct site from the agonist or antagonist binding site. The negative allosteric modulatory effects of CBD are therapeutically important as direct agonists are limited by their psychomimetic effects while direct antagonists are limited by their depressant effects [A32469].","Cannabinoid receptor 1|Cannabinoid receptor 2|G-protein coupled receptor 12|Glycine receptor subunit alpha-1|Glycine receptor (alpha-1/beta)|Glycine receptor subunit alpha-3|N-arachidonyl glycine receptor|G-protein coupled receptor 55|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A|Neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7|Delta-type opioid receptor|Mu-type opioid receptor|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1|Voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1G|Voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1H|Voltage-dependent T-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1I|Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily A member 1|Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8|Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2|Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 3|Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4|Non-selective voltage-gated ion channel VDAC1|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A|Adenosine receptor A1|Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1|Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2|Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase, mitochondrial|Steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase|3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase|Glutathione reductase, mitochondrial|Glutathione peroxidase 1|Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1|NAD(P)H dehydrogenase [quinone] 1|Catalase|Superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn]|Serotonin N-acetyltransferase|N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase","cannabinoid receptor 1|cannabinoid receptor 2|g-protein coupled receptor 12|glycine receptor subunit alpha-1|glycine receptor (alpha-1/beta)|glycine receptor subunit alpha-3|n-arachidonyl glycine receptor|g-protein coupled receptor 55|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1a|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2a|neuronal acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-7|delta-type opioid receptor|mu-type opioid receptor|peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 1|voltage-dependent t-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1g|voltage-dependent t-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1h|voltage-dependent t-type calcium channel subunit alpha-1i|transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily a member 1|transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily m member 8|transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 2|transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 3|transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily v member 4|non-selective voltage-gated ion channel vdac1|5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3a|adenosine receptor a1|prostaglandin g/h synthase 1|prostaglandin g/h synthase 2|acetyl-coa acetyltransferase, mitochondrial|steroid 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase|3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme a reductase|glutathione reductase, mitochondrial|glutathione peroxidase 1|indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1|nad(p)h dehydrogenase [quinone] 1|catalase|superoxide dismutase [cu-zn]|serotonin n-acetyltransferase|n-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase","when used in combination with delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol as the product sativex, cannabidiol was given a standard marketing authorization (ie. a notice of compliance (noc)) by health canada for the following indications:

DB09098,Somatrem,"Somatrem is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for: (a) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (GHD), (b) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to idiopathic short stature (ISS),  (c) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to Turner syndrome (TS), (d) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation, (e) treatment of adults with childhood-onset GHD, or (f) treatment of adults with adult-onset GHD [FDA Label].","Somatrem - as well as endogenous growth hormone - binds to dimeric growth hormone (GH) receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects [L1896, FDA Label]. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin like growth factor (IGF-1) produced in the liver and also locally (ie. skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (ie. lipolysis) [L1896, FDA Label].

Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of growing bone [FDA Label]. Growth and metabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and its mediator IGF-I [FDA Label]. Serum levels of IGF-I are low in children and adolescents who are growth hormone deficient, but increase during somatrem treatment [FDA Label]. New bone is consequently formed at the epiphyses for paediatric patients in response to GH and IGF-I from somatrem treatment [FDA Label]. This results in linear growth until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty [FDA Label].

Somatrem treatment also causes an increase in both the number and the size of skeletal muscle cells [FDA Label]. Additionally, such therapy also influences the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and increases red cell mass [FDA Label].

Linear skeletal bone growth is facilitated in part by GH-stimulated protein synthesis [FDA Label]. This is demonstrated by nitrogen retention as reflected by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during somatrem therapy [FDA Label]. GH also acts as a modulator of carbohydrate metabolism which may improve a fasting hypoglycaemia feeling that some patients with inadequate GH secretion sometimes experience [FDA Label]. Additionally, somatrem administration may decrease insulin sensitivity, resulting in increased serum fasting and postprandial insulin levels - usually more commonly in overweight or obese individuals, adults or children [FDA Label]. Moreover, mean fasting and postprandial glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels remained in the normal range [FDA Label].

Furthermore, in growth hormone deficient patients, the use of somatrem resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, increased plasma fatty acids, and decreased plasma cholesterol levels [FDA Label]. Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus may increase slightly in patients with inadequate secretion of endogenous GH, chronic kidney disease, or Turner syndrome during somatrem therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth as well as increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney [FDA Label]. Serum calcium is not significantly altered in somatrem patients [FDA Label]. Sodium retention and increases in serum alkaline phosphatase can occur to patients taking somatrem [FDA Label]. As well, GH can stimulate the synthesis of chondroitin sulphate and collagen as well as the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline [FDA Label].",Growth hormone receptor|Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor,growth hormone receptor|insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor,"somatrem is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for: (a) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (ghd), (b) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to idiopathic short stature (iss),  (c) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to turner syndrome (ts), (d) treatment of paediatric patients with growth failure due to chronic kidney disease (ckd) up to the time of renal transplantation, (e) treatment of adults with childhood-onset ghd, or (f) treatment of adults with adult-onset ghd [fda label].","somatrem - as well as endogenous growth hormone - binds to dimeric growth hormone (gh) receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects [l1896, fda label]. some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin like growth factor (igf-1) produced in the liver and also locally (ie. skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (ie. lipolysis) [l1896, fda label].

DB09099,Somatostatin,"For the symptomatic treatment of acute bleeding from esophageal varices. Other treatment options for long-term management of the condition may be considered if necessary, once initial control has been established.","Somatostatin binds to 5 subtypes of somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), which are all Gi-protein-coupled transmembrane receptors that inhibits adenylyl cyclase upon activation [A20384]. By inhibiting intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca2+ and by a receptor-linked distal effect on exocytosis, SSTRs block cell secretion [A27323]. The common pathway shared by the receptors involve the activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP), and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) [A27323]. With the exception of SSTR3, activation of SSTRs lead to activation of voltage-gated potassium channels accompanied by increased K+ currents. This result in membrane hyperpolarization and inhibits depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels [A20384]. Depending on the receptor subtype, signalling cascades involve activation of other downstream targets such as Na+/H+ exchanger, Rho GTPase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) [A20384]. SSTRs 1 to 4 bind both somatostatin isoforms with equal nanomolar binding affinity whereas SSTR5 exhibits a 5- to 10-fold higher binding affinity for SST-28 [A20384]. 

**Effects of SSTR1:** Upon biding of somatostatin and activation, SSTR1 mediates an antisecretory effect on growth hormone, prolactin and calcitonin [A20384]. 

**Effects of SSTR2:** SSTR2 subtype dominates in endocrine tissues. By binding to SST2 receptors, somatostatin exerts paracrine inhibitory actions on gastrin release from G cells, histamine release from ECL cells, and directly on parietal cell acid output [T28]. SSTR2 receptor signalling cascades also inhibit the secretion of growth hormone and that of adrenocorticotropin, glucagon, insulin, and interferon-γ [A20384]. 

**Effects of SSTR3:** Activation of these receptors lead to reduction in cell proliferation [A20384]. SSTR3 triggers PTP-dependent cell apoptosis accompanied by activation of p53 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax [A27323]. A study of the matrigel sponge assay suggests that through SSTR3-mediated inhibition of both NOS and MAPK activities may lead to the antitumor effects of somatostatin in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis [A32606].

**Effects of SSTR4:** The functions of SSTR4 remain largely unknown [A20384].

**Effects of SSTR5:** Like SSTR2, SSTR5 subtype also predominates in endocrine tissues. Upon activation, SSTR5 signalling cascades exert an inhibitory action on growth hormone, adrenocorticotropin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 as well as the secretion of amylase [A20384].

The presence of somatostatin receptors has been identified in most neuroendocrine tumours, endocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumors, paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) and small cell lung carcinomas [A32600]. The antitumor effects of somatostatin were also effective in various malignant lymphomas and breast tumours [A32600]. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), as well as growth hormones and growth factors are thought to be elevated in gastrointestinal tract and neuroendocrine tumours and are inhibited by somatostatin [A32595]. _In vitro_, somatostatin inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis and replication following  which suggest that somatostatin may have direct anti-proliferative effects via SSTR signalling [A32595]. Acromegaly is characterized as the endocrine disorder caused by a functioning tumour of cells that secrete growth hormone from the anterior pituitary [T28]. Somatostatin analogue therapies serve to normalize the elevated levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and attenuate tumour growth.  

In the vascular system this likely produces vasoconstriction by inhibiting adenylate cyclase leading to a lowering the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the endothelial cells which ultimately blocks vasodilation through this pathway. This vasoconstriction is though the be responsible for reducing blood flow to the esophageal tissues and so reduces bleeding from esophageal varices [A27145]. 

Somatostatin mediates an analgesic activity by reducing vascular and nociceptive components of inflammation [A32599]. Studies indicate that somatostatin may be present in nociceptive DRG neurons with C-fibers and primary afferent neurons to inhibit the release of transmitters at the presynaptic junctions of the sensory-efferent nerve terminals [A20384].

When used for the treatment or prevention of toxicity associated with fluorouracil and other antimetabolites, uridine triacetate is utilized for its ability to compete with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) metabolites for incorporation into the genetic material of non-cancerous cells. It reduces toxicity and cell-death associated with two cytotoxic intermediates: 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP).  By pre-administering with uridine (as the prodrug uridine triacetate), higher doses of 5-FU can be given allowing for improved efficacy and a reduction in toxic side effects [A18578] such as neutropenia, mucositis, diarrhea, and hand–foot syndrome. 

Uridine triacetate is also used for replacement therapy in the treatment of hereditary orotic aciduria, also known as uridine monophosphate synthase (UMPS) deficiency. As a result of UMPS deficiency, patients experience a  systemic deficiency of pyrimidine nucleotides, accounting for most symptoms of the disease. Additionally, orotic acid from the de novo pyrimidine pathway that cannot be converted to UMP is excreted in the urine, accounting for the common name of the disorder, orotic aciduria.

[L1127]

In postmenopausal women, strontium ranelate can also reduce the risk of vertebral and hip fractures [L1127].","The underlying pathogenesis of osteperosis involves an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. Osteoclasts are a kind of differentiated or specialized bone cell that breaks down bone tissue while osteoblasts are another set of differentiated bone cells that synthesize and rebuild bone tissue. When osteoclasts degrade bone tissue faster than the osteoblasts are capable of rebuilding the bone tissue, low or inadequate bone mass density and osteoperosis can resula One of the mechanisms with which strontium ranelate is thought to act is its functionality as an agonist of the extracellular calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs) [A31553] of osteoblasts and osteoclasts [A31542]. Ordinary interaction between calcium 2+ divalent cations with mature osteoclast CaSRs is known to induce osteoclast apoptosis. Subsequently, strontium 2+ divalent cations from strontium ranelate use can also bind CaSRs on osteoclasts to induce their apoptosis because of the strontium 2+ cation's close resemeblance to calcium 2+. Contact between extracelluar calcium 2+ and osteoclast CaSRs stimulates the phospholipase C (PLC) dependant breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) into the two secondary messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Whereas the calcium-CaSRs interaction then performs IP3 Adependent translocation of nuclear factor NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in mature osteoclasts, strontium-CaSRs interactions involves a DAG-PKC beta II (protein kinase C beta II) signalling pathway for translocating NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an IP3-independent manner. Although the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ mediated signalling pathways are different, both CaSR interactions induce osteoclast apoptosis and are in fact capable of potentiating each other, leading to enhanced osteoclast apoptosis and decreased bone tissue degradation [A31565].

At the same time, given the similarity between the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ cations, strontium 2+ cations from strontium ranelate are seemingly also able to act as an agonist and stimulate the CaSRs on osteoblasts, possibly in tandem with various local osteoblast stimulatory growth factors like transforming growth factor β (TGF β) and/or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), to stimulate cyclic D genes and early oncogenes like c-fos and egr-1 that can mediate the mitogenesis and proliferation of new or more osteoblasts [A31580]. Moreover, although the involvement of the PLC mediated pathway may be a part of the signalling mechanism in osteoblasts following the stimulation of their CaSRs, this has not yet been fully elucidated [A31580].

Furthermore, strontium ranelate is also thought to be capable of stimulating osteoblasts to enhance the expression of osteoprotegerin while also concurrently reducing the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) in primary human osteoblastic cells. As osteoprotegerin can competitively bind to RANKL as a decoy receptor, which can prevent RANKL from binding to RANK, which is an activity that facilitates the signaling pathway for the differentiation and activaiton of osteoclasts. The subsequent net effect of these actions ultiamtely results in decreased osteoclastogenesis. [A31553]

Moreover, bone biopsies obtained from patients treated with stronatium ranelate in clinical study reveal improvements in intrinsic bone tissue quality and microarchitecutre in ostepoerosis as evidenced by increased trabecular number, decreased trabecular separation, lower structure model index, and increased cortical thickness associated with a shift in trabecular structure from rod to plate like configurations compared with control patients [A31553].

Additionally, strontium from administered strontium ranelate is absorbed onto the crystal surface of treated bones and only slightly substitiutes for calcium in the apatite crystal of newly formed bone. As a result, there is an increased X-ray absorption of strontium as compared to calcium, which can lead to an amplification of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-proton X-ray absorptiometry. In essence, although strontium ranelate use can increase BMD some of the observations may be overestimations due to skeletal accretion of strontium in strontium ranelate treated patients [A31553].

Chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (IR). IR-mediated signalling pathway involves phoshorylation of multiple intracellular domains and protein kinases, and downstream effector molecules [A32353]. Upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of IR autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the IR, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol 2-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase B (Akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter-4 (Glut4)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake [A32353]. Chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pI3-kinase and Akt. 

Under insulin-resistant conditions, chromium also promotes GLUT-4 transporter translocation that is independent of activity of IR, IRS-1, PI3-kinase, or Akt; chromium mediates cholesterol efflux from the membranes via increasing fluidity of the membrane by decreasing the membrane cholesterol and upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein [A32353]. As a result, intracellular GLUT-4 transporters are stimulated to translocate from intracellular to the plasma membrane, leading to enhanced glucose uptake in muscle cells [L1990]. Chromium attenuates the activity of PTP-1B _in vitro,_ which is a negative regulator of insulin signaling. It also alleviates ER stress that is observed to be elevated the suppression of insulin signaling. ER stress is thought to activate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which subsequently induces serine phosphorylation of IRS and aberration of insulin signalling [A32353]. Transient upregulation of AMPK by chromium also leads to increased glucose uptake [A32353].",Cytochrome b5,cytochrome b5,"indicated for use as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for total parenteral nutrition (tpn), to maintain chromium serum levels and to prevent depletion of endogenous stores and subsequent deficiency symptoms [fda label].","chromium is an essential nutrient involved in the metabolism of glucose, insulin and blood lipids. its role in potentiating insulin signalling cascades has been implicated in several studies. chromium upregulates insulin-stimulated insulin signal transduction via affecting effector molecules downstream of the insulin receptor (ir). ir-mediated signalling pathway involves phoshorylation of multiple intracellular domains and protein kinases, and downstream effector molecules [a32353]. upon activation by ligands, intracellular β-subunit of ir autophosphorylates and activates tyrosine kinase domain of the ir, followed by activation and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins and downstream signalling effectors including phosphatidylinositol 2-kinase (pi3k). pi3k activates further downstream reaction cascades to activate protein kinase b (akt) to ultimately promote translocation of glucose transporter-4 (glut4)-vesicles from the cytoplasm to the cell surface and regulate glucose uptake [a32353]. chromium enhances the kinase activity of insulin receptor β and increases the activity of downstream effectors, pi3-kinase and akt.

In addition to the above, potassium hydroxide is used as a softener for nail grooves [L1949].","The exact mechanism of action of KOH is not known but the speculated one is that topical application of KOH digests keratin, and induces inflammation [L1948].

The mechanism of skin injury by alkali substances such as potassium hydroxide is by the saponification of fat, causing fatty tissue to lose its function with increased damage due to a heat reaction. Extraction of water from cells occurs due to the hygroscopic (absorbent) nature of alkali. Dissolution of proteins also occurs, allowing for deeper penetration of OH- ions and resulting in various chemical reactions [L1955].

The alkali penetrates the skin quickly, saponifies plasma membranes, denatures collagen proteins, and leads to vascular thromboses in the conjunctiva and other parts of the eye. The resulting corneal burns include scarring and opacification of the cornea with resulting in vision loss, corneal neovascularization, ulcer formation, and perforation. Other consequences of untreated or very severe alkali burns include epithelial erosions, secondary glaucoma, and causes the destruction of conjunctival mucus cells, causing dry eyes, trichiasis (misdirected eyelash hairs), and other ocular conditions [L1955].

In the gastrointestinal tract, after oral ingestion, burns may result. The mechanism of injury is liquefactive necrosis. The thrombosis of gastrointestinal blood vessels also contributes to tissue damage.

DB11157,Anthralin,"Stable plaque psoriasis of the skin and scalp [L1933].

It is also used topically in the management of psoriasis, dermatoses, and alopecia areata. Anthralin is also used in biomedical research due to its effect on EGFR autophosphorylation [L1936].","Anthralin inhibits the proliferation of keratinocytes (epidermal skin cells), prevents the action of T-cells, and promotes cell differentiation, likely through mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, the production of free radicals may contribute to its anti-psoriatic effect [L1979]. In vitro studies demonstrate that anthralin prolongs the prophase component of mitosis for keratinocytes and leukocytes [L1932].  Prophase is the first step of mitosis, the process separating the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells [L1980]. In vivo studies demonstrate that anthralin blocks DNA synthesis and can increase the release of reactive oxygen species [L1932].

Anthralin is believed to normalize the rate of epidermal cell proliferation and keratinization by reducing the mitotic activity of the epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis [L1979].


Anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of anthralin have been demonstrated on both psoriatic and healthy skin. The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin are thought to be due to a combination of inhibition of DNA synthesis and its strong reducing properties. The effectiveness of anthralin as an anti-psoriatic agent is partly owed to its ability to promote lipid peroxidation and reduce the concentration of endothelial adhesion molecules, which are found to be elevated in psoriatic patients [L1933], [L1979].

Benzophenone sunscreens, applied topically, protect the skin from these harmful effects of ultraviolet light by chemically absorbing light energy (photons). As this occurs, the benzophenone molecule becomes activated to higher energy levels. As the excited molecule returns to its ground state, the energy is released in the form of thermal energy.

In particular, the antimicrobial activity of quaternary ammonium with an alkyl chain is related to lipolhilia and peaks between C12 and C16 for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains [A33149].

DB11254,Hexylresorcinol,"Hexylresorcinol is predominantly employed as the active ingredient in lotions, sprays, or lozenges indicated as a (a) topical antiseptic to help prevent skin infection in minor cuts, scrapes, or burns, or (b) as an antiseptic and local anesthetic for the relief of a sore throat and its associated pain [L2734, L2735].

In addition, hexylresorcinol is used as an active ingredient in various commercial cosmetic skincare products as an anti-aging cream [L2736] while other studies have looked into whether or not the compound could be used effectively as an anti-inflammatory agent or even as an anti-cancer therapy [L2736].","When acting as an oral anesthetic for relieving sore throats, it is generally believed that hexylresorcinol is possibly capable of blocking voltage-gated neuronal sodium channels, which in turn would inhibit the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses for feeling or transmitting pain signals in the local area to which the hexylresorcinol is applied [F58].

As an antiseptic agent, studies have demonstrated that hexylresorcinol is capable of eliciting actions like reducing or inhibiting the generation of bacterial biofilm, interfering with bacterial cell chain formation, reducing bacterial adherence of the pharynx, inhibition of glycolytic enzyme and pH drops, and alteration of cell surface hydrophobicity [A33017]. Unfortunately, there are either antibiotics that function even more effectively at formally treating bacterial growth or there are also other plant-derived phenolic compounds similar to hexylresorcinol that elicit stronger such mechanisms of action [A33017]. Nevertheless, it is useful for hexylresorcinol to have both anesthetic and certain antiseptic actions for its use in treating various relatively self-limiting scrapes and sore throats that are treated by the over-the-counter products that feature the compound. Early studies in the 1930s and 1940s suggested that there were more effective medicines over hexylresorcinol that could be employed for their anthelmintic effects [A33020].

As an anti-inflammatory and anti-aging agent, some studies have shown that it may be possible for hexylresorcinol to inhibit the phosphorylation of the immune response mediator NF-kappaB and also elicit a significant skin lightening effect owing to a strong inhibitory effect on tyrosinase and peroxidase and a stimulatory effect on glutathione and E-cadherin syntheses [L2736]. It is proposed that hexylresorcinol can bind to tyrosinase directly and inhibits its enzyme activity [L2736]. Literature data suggests that low glutathione levels relates to the deposition of melanin in the skin of humans and other animals, while high glutathione levels inhibit melanogenesis [L2736]. And ultimately, it is also reported that glutathione depletion increases tyrosinase activity in human melanoma cells, which makes hexylresorcinol's effects on tyrosinase desirable [L2736].

Finally, there are ongoing studies that have reported hexylresorcinol's abilities to induce the differentiation of SCC-9 squamous cell cell-line by way of the modulation of the E2F-mediated signaling pathway and suppress the growth of squamous cell carcinoma SCC-9 cells in a dose-dependent manner [L2736]. Moreover, such studies have also shown that hexylresorcinol is seemingly capable of dose-dependent induction of SCC-9 cell apoptosis as well as the inhibition of transglutaminase-2 enzyme activity which can facilitate chemotherapy resistance [L2736].",Tyrosinase|DNA topoisomerase 1|Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2,tyrosinase|dna topoisomerase 1|protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2,"hexylresorcinol is predominantly employed as the active ingredient in lotions, sprays, or lozenges indicated as a (a) topical antiseptic to help prevent skin infection in minor cuts, scrapes, or burns, or (b) as an antiseptic and local anesthetic for the relief of a sore throat and its associated pain [l2734, l2735].

as an antiseptic agent, studies have demonstrated that hexylresorcinol is capable of eliciting actions like reducing or inhibiting the generation of bacterial biofilm, interfering with bacterial cell chain formation, reducing bacterial adherence of the pharynx, inhibition of glycolytic enzyme and ph drops, and alteration of cell surface hydrophobicity [a33017]. unfortunately, there are either antibiotics that function even more effectively at formally treating bacterial growth or there are also other plant-derived phenolic compounds similar to hexylresorcinol that elicit stronger such mechanisms of action [a33017]. nevertheless, it is useful for hexylresorcinol to have both anesthetic and certain antiseptic actions for its use in treating various relatively self-limiting scrapes and sore throats that are treated by the over-the-counter products that feature the compound. early studies in the 1930s and 1940s suggested that there were more effective medicines over hexylresorcinol that could be employed for their anthelmintic effects [a33020].

as an anti-inflammatory and anti-aging agent, some studies have shown that it may be possible for hexylresorcinol to inhibit the phosphorylation of the immune response mediator nf-kappab and also elicit a significant skin lightening effect owing to a strong inhibitory effect on tyrosinase and peroxidase and a stimulatory effect on glutathione and e-cadherin syntheses [l2736]. it is proposed that hexylresorcinol can bind to tyrosinase directly and inhibits its enzyme activity [l2736]. literature data suggests that low glutathione levels relates to the deposition of melanin in the skin of humans and other animals, while high glutathione levels inhibit melanogenesis [l2736]. and ultimately, it is also reported that glutathione depletion increases tyrosinase activity in human melanoma cells, which makes hexylresorcinol's effects on tyrosinase desirable [l2736].

finally, there are ongoing studies that have reported hexylresorcinol's abilities to induce the differentiation of scc-9 squamous cell cell-line by way of the modulation of the e2f-mediated signaling pathway and suppress the growth of squamous cell carcinoma scc-9 cells in a dose-dependent manner [l2736]. moreover, such studies have also shown that hexylresorcinol is seemingly capable of dose-dependent induction of scc-9 cell apoptosis as well as the inhibition of transglutaminase-2 enzyme activity which can facilitate chemotherapy resistance [l2736]."

It is also thought that calcium glycerophosphate enhances the remineralization effect of sodium monofluorophosphate leading to greater remineralization of enamel but the mechanism behind this is unknown.

Calcium glycerophosphate reduces the decrease in plaque pH produced by sucrose solutions [A27153].

DB11265,Curcuma xanthorrhiza oil,"Indicated for the symptomatic relief of digestive disturbances, such as feelings of fullness, slow digestion and flatulence [F114].","The prinicipal components, [DB11672] and xanthorrhizol, mediate the main pharmacological actions of _Curcuma xanthorrhiza_ oil. 

**Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions:** Curcumin and xanthorrhizol are natural antioxidant to exert an anti-inflammatory effect by scavenging the reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, and singlet oxygen, or by chemically reducing oxidized compounds [A33160]. Curcumin inhibits liposomal peroxidation and peroxide-induced DNA damage, and the mechanism of action is thought to involve modulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and stimulation of ICAM- 1 [F114]. Based on the findings _in vitro_, xanthorrhizol may be a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to decrease their expression via NF-kB pathway and subsequently inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitric oxide (NO) [A33161]. In activated primary cultured microglial cells, xanthorrhizol was found to inhibit COX-2, iNOS, proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) [A33161]. 

**Hepatoprotective actions:** The hepatoprotective effect of _Curcuma xanthorrhiza_ oil is considered mainly a result of its antioxidant properties, as well as its ability to decrease the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [F114]. Xanthorrhizol may also attenuate phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) [A33161, F114]. 

**Antibacterial actions:** While the mode of antibacterial action of xanthorrhizol is not fully understood, it is thought to involve suppression of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by microbial infection [A33161]. 

**Anticancer actions:** The cytotoxic actions of xanthorrhizol against tumour cells is thought to be contributed by its phenol group and may involve its antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities, induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by reducing cyclin D1 proto-oncogene expression or triggering cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) [A33161]. In various cancer cell models, xanthorrhizol was shown to induce apoptosis via activation of p53-dependent mitochondrial pathway. In HeLa cervical cancer cells, xanthorrhizol upregulated p53 and Bax without any effects on Bax/Bcl-2 expression [A33161]. There is also evidence that xanthorrhizol-induced cell death is mediated by the activation of caspase. Xanthorrhizol increased the expression and promoter activity pro-apoptotic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-activated gene-1 (NAG-1), which is notably inhibited during the development of human colorectal cancer and neoplastic tumors [A33161]. Other mode of action involves the regulation of MAPK pathway and inhibition of Akt/NF-kB pathway [A33161].

**Estrogenic and anti-estrogenic actions:** _In vitro_, xanthorrhizol upregulated pS2 and promoted  the interaction of ER-estrogen response elements in MCF-7 cells. It acted as a partial estrogen antagonist of hERα in T47D cells [A33161]. Curcumin also activates gene expression in the breast cancer cell line MCF7, indicating that it may have low estrogenic activity [F114].",,,"indicated for the symptomatic relief of digestive disturbances, such as feelings of fullness, slow digestion and flatulence [f114].","the prinicipal components, [db11672] and xanthorrhizol, mediate the main pharmacological actions of _curcuma xanthorrhiza_ oil.

(a) UVA is long-range UV radiation between 320-400nm [L2791]. Although not as energetic as UVB, UVA can penetrate deep into the dermis [L2791]. UVA can cause immediate tanning, premature skin aging, and can also play a role in the formation of some skin cancers [L2791]. Approximately 95% of UVA from the sun passes through Earth's ozone layer [L2791].

(c) UVC is comprised of wavelengths between 100-280nm and is very energetic [L2791]. It is very dangerous to all forms of life, even when the exposure is short [L2791]. However, UVC radiation is generally filtered out by the ozone layer and never reaches the Earth [L2791].

(a) UVA is long-range UV radiation between 320-400nm [L2789]. Although not as energetic as UVB, UVA can penetrate deep into the dermis [L2789]. UVA can cause immediate tanning, premature skin aging, and can also play a role in the formation of some skin cancers [L2789]. Approximately 95% of UVA from the sun passes through Earth's ozone layer [L2789].

(b) UVB is short-wavelength UV radiation between 280-320nm [L2789]. It is capable of penetrating the outer protective layer of the skin and is responsible for delayed tanning, sunburns, and most skin cancers [L2789]. A large amount of UVB is absorbed by the ozone layer, however, as only 5% reaches the Earth's surface [L2789].

(c) UVC is comprised of wavelengths between 100-280nm and is very energetic [L2789]. It is very dangerous to all forms of life, even when the exposure is short [L2789]. However, UVC radiation is generally filtered out by the ozone layer and never reaches the Earth [L2789].

Ultimately, the shorter the wavelength, the more harmful the UV radiation - although shorter wavelength UV radiation is less able to penetrate the skin [L2789].

Subsequently, drometrizole trisiloxane is a broad spectrum lipophilic benzotriazole derivative chemical sunscreen that is capable of absorbing UVA and UVB radiation [A33069, L2780, L2781, L2782, L2783]. It is also photostable, meaning that it will not degrade in the presence of sunlight, unlike other UV filters like the widely used UVA absorber avobenzone [L2783].

Additionally, drometrizole trisiloxane is usually combined with other active sunscreen agents like titanium dioxide, avobenzone, and others to ensure the combined product covers or protects against as broad a spectrum of UV radiation as possible, considering drometrizole trisiloxane does not absorb against the entire range of UV radiation [L2783].

DB11605,Myrrh,"FDA approved only for use in food. Historically used for indigestion, ulcers, colds, cough, asthma, bronchial congestion, arthritic pain, cancer, leprosy, and syphilis. It is also used orally as a stimulant, antispasmodic, and to increase menstrual flow. Topically, myrrh is used for mild inflammation of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa, aphthous ulcers, gingivitis, chapped lips, hemorrhoids, bedsores, wounds, abrasions, furunculosis, bad breath, and loose teeth. In foods and beverages, myrrh is used as a flavoring component. In manufacturing, myrrh is used as a fragrance and fixative in cosmetics. It is also used in embalming and as incense.","**Anti-inflammatory:** Myrrh is thought to mediate its anti-inflammatory activity through inducing haem oxygenase activity [A19599]. Haem oxygenase then appears to prevent the degradation of IKBalpha in response to inflammatory receptor activation. This prevents translocation of nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) to the nucleus and inhibits the expression of genes under its control like cyclooxygenase-2 and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase. The suppression of the NFkappaB pathway likely also reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Myrhh also inhibits the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, specifically producing inhibition of p38 and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) [A19600]. This is associated with a reduction in c-jun and c-fos expression which would likely result in a reduction in activator protein-1 and and inhibition of its associated inflammatory gene expression. Myrrh exibits inhibitory activity against 5-lipoxygenase helping to suppress the production of leukotrienes, another class of inflammatory cytokine [A19601]. In addition to its effects on the NFkappaB system, myrrh also inhibits the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) -1 and -3 resulting in a decrease in cytokine production by the janus kinase/STAT pathway [A19615]. Myrrh also reduces the downregulation of suppresor of cytokine synthesis (SOCS) in response to interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma. SOCS serves as an autoregulator of the JAK/STAT pathway under transcriptional control of STATs and inhibits activation of the pathway.

**Analgesic:** Myrrh appears to produce an analgesic effect associated with its suppression of prostaglandin production [A19602]. Myrrh is also suggested to block inward sodium currents [A19618].

**Anticancer:** Myrrh displays an pro-apoptotic effect on cancer cells [A19598]. This seems to involve members of the Bcl family of proteins [A19603]. Myrrh induces the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax while decreasing the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl family. At low doses Myrrh seems to activate the MAPK pathway in cancer cells, promoting the phosphorylation of p38 and JNK [A19604]. The JNK activation in particular appears to mediate an apoptotic influence. Additionally, myrrh appears to induce reactive oxygen species generation in cancer cells further promoting apoptosis.

**Antioxidant:** The precise mechanism of myrrh's antioxidant property is unknown.

**Lipid lowering:** Compounds in myrrh bind to and inhibit the farnesoid X receptor resulting in a reduction in low density lipoprotein [A19609].

DB11638,Artenimol,"For the treatment of uncomplicated *Plasmodium falciparum* infection in adults, children, and infants aged 6 months and up weighing over 5 kg [FDA Label]. Used in combination with [DB13941].","Artemisinins, including Artenimol which is a major active metabolite of many artemisinins, are thought to act via a common mechanism [A31589]. While the exact mechanism of action is not certain, theories exist as to how artemisinins produce their antimalarial effect.

Artemisinins are believed to bind to haem within the *P. falciparum* parasite [A31564, A31588]. The source of this haem varies with the life stage of the parasite. When the parasite is in the early ring stage artemisinins are believed to bind haem produced by the parasite's haem biosynthesis pathway. In later stages artemisinins likely bind to haem released by haemoglobin digestion. Once bound to haem, artemisinins are thought to undergo activation involving ferrous iron via reductive scission which splits the endoperoxide bridge to produce a reactive oxygen [A31587, A31596]. This reactive oxygen is thought to undergo a subsequent intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce a reactive carbon radical [A31596]. The carbon radical is believed to be the source of the drugs potent activity against *P. falciparum* by alkylating a wide array of protein targets [A20257, A31564, A31596]. The nature and magnitude of the effect on specific protein function as a result of this alkylation is unknown.

One target which has been the focus of research is the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase pump of *P. falciparum* [A31594]. Artemisinins have been found to irreversably bind to and inhibit this protein at a binding site similar to that of Thapsigargin. The mechanism is likely the same as for other proteins, namely alkylation via the carbon radical intermediate.

Artemisinins appear to preferentially collect in infected erythrocytes, concentrating the drug by several hundred-fold compared to uninfected cells [A31597]. This may play a role in why little alkylation is seen in uninfected erythrocytes [A31595].","Actin, cytoplasmic 2|Alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase|Annexin A2|ATP synthase subunit alpha,

weighing over 5 kg [fda label]. used in combination with [db13941].","artemisinins, including artenimol which is a major active metabolite of many artemisinins, are thought to act via a common mechanism [a31589]. while the exact mechanism of action is not certain, theories exist as to how artemisinins produce their antimalarial effect.

artemisinins are believed to bind to haem within the *p. falciparum* parasite [a31564, a31588]. the source of this haem varies with the life stage of the parasite. when the parasite is in the early ring stage artemisinins are believed to bind haem produced by the parasite's haem biosynthesis pathway. in later stages artemisinins likely bind to haem released by haemoglobin digestion. once bound to haem, artemisinins are thought to undergo activation involving ferrous iron via reductive scission which splits the endoperoxide bridge to produce a reactive oxygen [a31587, a31596]. this reactive oxygen is thought to undergo a subsequent intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce a reactive carbon radical [a31596]. the carbon radical is believed to be the source of the drugs potent activity against *p. falciparum* by alkylating a wide array of protein targets [a20257, a31564, a31596]. the nature and magnitude of the effect on specific protein function as a result of this alkylation is unknown.

one target which has been the focus of research is the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+ atpase pump of *p. falciparum* [a31594]. artemisinins have been found to irreversably bind to and inhibit this protein at a binding site similar to that of thapsigargin. the mechanism is likely the same as for other proteins, namely alkylation via the carbon radical intermediate.

artemisinins appear to preferentially collect in infected erythrocytes, concentrating the drug by several hundred-fold compared to uninfected cells [a31597]. this may play a role in why little alkylation is seen in uninfected erythrocytes [a31595]."

- indicated for single-level lumbar interbody spine fusion as a substitute for autogenous bone graft in adults with degenerative disc disease who have had at least 6 months of non-operative treatment for this condition [L1391].","In the same pathway shared by endogenous BMPs, recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) binds and initiates intracellular signal cascade through an oligomeric transmembrane receptor complex formed by type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptor proteins [A31962]. These BMP receptors are expressed on the surface of mesenchymal cells and upon binding of BMP-2 to the BMP receptor type II, type II receptor phosphorylates and activates type I receptor. Type I receptor may also undergo autophosphorylation. Activated BMP type I receptor then phosphorylates intracellular effector proteins, the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) [A31946]. Smad1, Smad 5 and Smad 8 associate with the Co-Smad, Smad4 and once activated via complex formation, they translocate to the nucleus where they associate with other transcription factors and bind promoters of target genes to control their expression [A31946]. This ultimately results in bone formation at the site of implantation. Dibotermin alfa causes mesenchymal cells to differentiate into cartilage- and bone-forming cells. Implantation of dibotermin alfa in trabecular bone results in transient resorption of the bone surrounding the implant, followed by replacement of degraded matrix by newly differentiated cells [L1391].

In human bone cells isolated from adult mandibulae, recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) was shown to stimulate the activity of early biomarkers of osteoblast differentiation, including alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation [A31952]. At concentrations of 500 ng/mL, rhBMP-2 also enhanced the mRNA expression level of PTH/PTH related-peptide receptor in human bone cells [A31952]. There was evidence that rhBMP-2 inhibits 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced osteocalcin synthesis at both the mRNA and protein level. rhBMP-2 also significantly suppressed MMP-1 production and MMP-1 mRNA expression at concentrations exceeding 500 ng/mL [A31952].",Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2|Bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1A,bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-2|bone morphogenetic protein receptor type-1a,"- indicated for the treatment of acute tibia fractures in adults, as an adjunct to standard care using open fracture reduction and intramedullary unreamed nail fixation [fda label].

DB11641,Vinflunine,For use as a monotherapy in adults with advanced or transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing therapy [L2381].,"Microtubules are a major component of the cytoskeleton that have a critical role in maintenance of cell shape, mobility, adhesion and intracellular integrity. They also play a role in the formation of the mitotic spindle and chromosomal segregation to the daughter cells at mitosis [A32635]. Via GTP hydrolysis at the β-tubulin subunit and polymerization of tubulin into linear polymers, microtubules, or macromolecular filaments composed of tubulin heterodimers, are formed via a mechanism of nucleation-elongation [A32635]. At the onset of mitosis, the interphase microtubule network disassembles into the tubulin. The tubulin reassembles into a new population of mitotic spindle microtubules that further undergo rapid successions of lengthening and shortening until they are attached to the newly duplicated sister chromatids at their centromeres [A32635]. The dynamic behaviour of microtubules are characterized by two mechanical process: dynamic instability indicating repeated switches of growth and shortening at the ends, and microtubule treadmilling that involves the fast-growing (+) end of the microtubule accompanied by a net loss of the opposite slow-growing (-) end [A32635]. Microtubule treadmilling plays a critical role in mitosis by generating the forces for separation of the chromosomes in the mitotic spindle from centrosome and kinetochores. 

In both cancer and normal cells, vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites at β-tubulin. It is proposed that in similarity to other vinca alkaloids, vinflunine is most likely to bind to β-tubulin subunit at the interdimer interface [A32635]. Via direct binding to tubulin, vinflunine inhibits microtubule polymerization and induces a G2+M arrest, or a mitotic arrest [A32626]. Vinflunine disrupts the dynamic function of microtubules by suppressing treadmilling and slowing the microtubule growth rate while increasing growth duration [A31982]. Ultimately, mitotic accumulation at the metaphase/anaphase transition results in cell apoptosis [A32626].",Tubulin beta chain,tubulin beta chain,for use as a monotherapy in adults with advanced or transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract after failure of a prior platinum-containing therapy [l2381].,"microtubules are a major component of the cytoskeleton that have a critical role in maintenance of cell shape, mobility, adhesion and intracellular integrity. they also play a role in the formation of the mitotic spindle and chromosomal segregation to the daughter cells at mitosis [a32635]. via gtp hydrolysis at the β-tubulin subunit and polymerization of tubulin into linear polymers, microtubules, or macromolecular filaments composed of tubulin heterodimers, are formed via a mechanism of nucleation-elongation [a32635]. at the onset of mitosis, the interphase microtubule network disassembles into the tubulin. the tubulin reassembles into a new population of mitotic spindle microtubules that further undergo rapid successions of lengthening and shortening until they are attached to the newly duplicated sister chromatids at their centromeres [a32635]. the dynamic behaviour of microtubules are characterized by two mechanical process: dynamic instability indicating repeated switches of growth and shortening at the ends, and microtubule treadmilling that involves the fast-growing (+) end of the microtubule accompanied by a net loss of the opposite slow-growing (-) end [a32635]. microtubule treadmilling plays a critical role in mitosis by generating the forces for separation of the chromosomes in the mitotic spindle from centrosome and kinetochores.

DB11735,Galactose,"There are limited therapeutic uses for which galactose is formally indicated. Some predominant indications include (a) the use of galactose to facilitate the construction of structurally and immunologically effective attenuated vaccines [T188, L2633], and (b) the role galactose plays as an essential element in the formation of lactulose - a synthetic disaccharide indicated for the treatment of constipation and/or hepatic encephalopathy (HE); hepatic coma [L2632].

Nevertheless, there are many studies looking into a variety of possible uses for galactose, including the use of the monosaccharide sugar for accelerating senescence in mice, rats, and Drosophila [A32853, A32854], the proposed association between galactose in consumed milk and ovarian cancer [A32855, A32856], a possible role in the therapy of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [A32858], among various others. Regardless, none of these proposed indications have yet been formally elucidated for practical use.","In the development of typhoid Ty21a live oral vaccine, the use of exogenous galactose is critical. When dealing with Salmonella typhimurium, it has been shown that rough strains with incomplete lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lacking O-specific side chains are much less virulent than smooth strains with complete LPS with O-specific side chains [T188]. Salmonella typhimurium gal E mutants used to produce the vaccine are effectively avirulent and highly protective but lack the specific UDP-galactose 4-epimerase enzyme which allows for the normal synthesis of UDP-galactose from UDP-glucose [T188]. The consequence of this mutant defect is that the gal E mutants can only generate incomplete LPS without O-specific antigen side chains, which are not capable enough as the complete LPS with O-specific side chains at generating an immunologic response [T188]. When exogenous galactose is added to the vaccine medium, however, it allows the mutants to generate UDP-galactose via galactose 1-phosphate [T188]. This ultimately allows the mutants to form smooth-type LPS with O-specific side chains [T188]. Regardless, the mutant's epimerase defect ultimately results in the accumulation of such intermediary products like galactose 1-phosphate and UDP-galactose, which consequently causes lysis of the mutant cells. The resultant vaccine is subsequently effective enough to elicit an immunologic response while the bacteriolysis prevents the mutant cells from regaining virulence under conditions where smooth type LPS similar to the active parental strain is synthesized [T188].

Galactose is also an essential element to the chemical structure of the commonly used laxative solution lactulose. Lactulose itself is a synthetic disaccharide that is made in parts from lactose, galactose, and various other sugars [F30]. It is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and no enzyme capable of hydrolysis of lactulose is present in human gastrointestinal tissue [F30]. Oral doses of lactulose subsequently arrive at the colon largely unchanged [F30]. At the colon, lactulose is finally broken down predominantly to lactic acid, and also small amounts of formic and acetic acids by the action of colonic bacteria, which results in an increase in osmotic pressure and slight acidification of the colonic contents [F30]. This action consequently causes an increase in stool water content and softens the stool for a laxative effect [F30].",,,"there are limited therapeutic uses for which galactose is formally indicated. some predominant indications include (a) the use of galactose to facilitate the construction of structurally and immunologically effective attenuated vaccines [t188, l2633], and (b) the role galactose plays as an essential element in the formation of lactulose - a synthetic disaccharide indicated for the treatment of constipation and/or hepatic encephalopathy (he); hepatic coma [l2632].

* Inidicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.","Regulation of cell cycle is crucial in maintaining proper cell growth; dysregulated cell cycle signalling pathway is a key component in inducing hyperproliferation of cells and tumor formation in various cancers. G1 to S phase cell cycle progression, or transition through the G1 restriction point (R), is promoted by the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb)-mediated pathway. Activation of Rb-mediated pathway requires the interaction of Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6 with D-type cyclins, which drives the formation of active CDK4/CDK6 and subsequent phosphorylation of Rb [A27281, A27282]. 

Rb is a tumor suppressant protein that inhibits proliferation through binding to and suppressing the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors [A27281]. However, phosphorylation of Rb relieves suppression of E2F to allow expression of genes required for passage through the restriction point [A27281]. This leads to increased expression of downstream signalling molecules and activity of protein kinases that promote the cell cycle progression and initiation of DNA replication. Phosphorylation of Rb and other proteins by CDK4/6 additionally leads to transcription of genes involved in cell cycle-independent activities including signal transduction, DNA repair transcriptional control, and mRNA processing [A27281]. 

Abemaciclib selectively inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 with low nanomolar potency, inhibits Rb phosphorylation resulting in a G1 arrest and inhibition of proliferation, and its activity is specific for Rb-proficient cells [A27281]. Unlike other CDK inhibitors such as [DB09073] and [DB11730], abemaciclib exhibits greater selectivity for CDK4 compared to CDK6 [A27282].",Cyclin-dependent kinase 4|Cyclin-dependent kinase 6,cyclin-dependent kinase 4|cyclin-dependent kinase 6,"* indicated in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of women with hormone receptor (hr)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (her2)-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy.

DB12007,Isoflavone,Indicated for over-the-counter use as a dietary supplement for increasing bone density and regulating blood fat.,"Isoflavones are selective estrogen receptor modulators that exert estrogenic-like effects under certain experimental conditions [A33098], as they are structurally similar to mammalian 17β-estradiol. They may bind to both α and β isoforms of estrogen receptor (ER), but with binding affinities to ERβ approximately 20 times higher than that to ERα [A33099]. The role of isoflavones on estrogen-dependent cancer has been studied, since they may mediate antiestrogenic actions by blocking the binding of endogenous estrogens and their receptor signalling [A33100]. In cell culture, [DB01645] inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, probably by arresting the cell cycle progression at the G2–M transition [A33100]. In addition, genistein was shown to induce apoptosis, modify eicosanoid metabolism, and inhibit angiogenesis [A33100]. There is an evidence that soy isoflavones may act on androgen receptors to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity, thereby blocking the growth and proliferation of cancer cells [A33100]. 

Isoflavones may not significantly contribute to the hypolipidemic effects of soy protein, but may exert coronary benefits by improving endothelial function; in clinical trials of postmenopausal women, isoflavones improved flow-mediated dilation in women with impaired endothelial function [A33098]. Some observational data suggests that isoflavones improve endothelial function by increasing the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, which replace damaged endothelial cells [A33098]. Isoflavone may modulate the key transcription factors involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism by acting on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma, which are receptors that regulate the transcription of genes involved in lipid and glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism [A33100]. Multiple biological actions of isoflavones, such as favorable effect on the blood lipid profile and inhibition of LDL cholesterol oxidation, may lead to cardio protective effects [A33100]. 

[DB01645] has been shown to have antioxidant properties on hydrogen peroxide production _in vitro_ and blocks the formation of oxygen free radicals [A33100]. Studies also suggest that at micromolar concentrations, genistein increases glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in cell lines and mouse pancreatic islets via a cAMP-dependent protein kinase mechanism [A33100]. Based on the findings of experimental studies, genistein may exert a positive effect on bone formation by decreasing osteoclastic resorption factor, such as collagen C-telopeptide, and increasing osteoblastic formation markers, such as bone-alkaline phosphatase [A33100]. _In vitro_, it antagonized the catabolic effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in osteoblasts by reversing the PTH-induced increase in soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-xB ligand and decrease in osteoprotegerin expression [A33100].",Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma,peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha|peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma,indicated for over-the-counter use as a dietary supplement for increasing bone density and regulating blood fat.,"isoflavones are selective estrogen receptor modulators that exert estrogenic-like effects under certain experimental conditions [a33098], as they are structurally similar to mammalian 17β-estradiol. they may bind to both α and β isoforms of estrogen receptor (er), but with binding affinities to erβ approximately 20 times higher than that to erα [a33099]. the role of isoflavones on estrogen-dependent cancer has been studied, since they may mediate antiestrogenic actions by blocking the binding of endogenous estrogens and their receptor signalling [a33100]. in cell culture, [db01645] inhibited the proliferation of mda-mb-231 human breast cancer cells, probably by arresting the cell cycle progression at the g2–m transition [a33100]. in addition, genistein was shown to induce apoptosis, modify eicosanoid metabolism, and inhibit angiogenesis [a33100]. there is an evidence that soy isoflavones may act on androgen receptors to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity, thereby blocking the growth and proliferation of cancer cells [a33100].

DB12010,Fostamatinib,Fostamatinib is indicated for use in the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in patients who have had insufficient response to previous therapy [FDA Label].,"The active metabolite of fostamatinib, R406, is an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) [A32899]. It binds reversibly to the ATP binding pocket with high affinity (Ki = 30nM), inhibiting the kinase activity with an IC50 of 41nM.

Syk is a cytosolic protein kinase and part of the signalling cascade which occurs with Fc receptors, TCRs, and BCRs [A32898]. It contains two src homology 2 (SH2) domains separated by a linker domain. These SH2 domains bind to tyrosine residues on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif phosphorylated by Lyn, another kinase in the cascade. This motif is located on the cytoplasmic regions of several immune receptors including Fc receptors, TCRs, BCRs, and natural killer cell receptors. The flexibility provided by the linker enables the protein to bind to many receptor types. Inhibition of Syk suppresses downstream signal transduction [A32899].

While Syk plays a role in some pathways involved in the generation of the oxidative burst by neutrophils or phagocytosis by macrophages, R406 does not have a significant effect on these processes [A32899]. This is likely due to redundant pathways which do not involve Syk. Similarly Syk does not produce significant effects on platelet activation despite its involvement in glycoprotein IV and integrin based signalling. Activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity by natural killer cells is also unaffected despite the involvement of Syk in Fc receptor signalling [A32898].

R406 binds to the adenosine A3 receptor as an antagonist as well as the adenosine and monoamine uptake transporters as an inhibitor [A32899,A32906]. It has also been found to be an inhibitor of UDP glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1, phosphodiesterase PDE5, fatty acid amide hydrolase, 5-lipoxygenase, cathepsin L, and cathepsin S [A32906]. R406 appears to inhibit a wide range of kinases at higher concentrations [A32906]. It is thought that inhibition of some of these targets may be responsible for the increase in blood pressure seen with fostamatinib.","Tyrosine-protein kinase SYK|Adenosine receptor A3|Synaptic

chronic immune thrombocytopenia (itp) in patients who have had insufficient response to previous therapy [fda label].,"the active metabolite of fostamatinib, r406, is an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (syk) [a32899]. it binds reversibly to the atp binding pocket with high affinity (ki = 30nm), inhibiting the kinase activity with an ic50 of 41nm.

syk is a cytosolic protein kinase and part of the signalling cascade which occurs with fc receptors, tcrs, and bcrs [a32898]. it contains two src homology 2 (sh2) domains separated by a linker domain. these sh2 domains bind to tyrosine residues on the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activating motif phosphorylated by lyn, another kinase in the cascade. this motif is located on the cytoplasmic regions of several immune receptors including fc receptors, tcrs, bcrs, and natural killer cell receptors. the flexibility provided by the linker enables the protein to bind to many receptor types. inhibition of syk suppresses downstream signal transduction [a32899].

while syk plays a role in some pathways involved in the generation of the oxidative burst by neutrophils or phagocytosis by macrophages, r406 does not have a significant effect on these processes [a32899]. this is likely due to redundant pathways which do not involve syk. similarly syk does not produce significant effects on platelet activation despite its involvement in glycoprotein iv and integrin based signalling. activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity by natural killer cells is also unaffected despite the involvement of syk in fc receptor signalling [a32898].

r406 binds to the adenosine a3 receptor as an antagonist as well as the adenosine and monoamine uptake transporters as an inhibitor [a32899,a32906]. it has also been found to be an inhibitor of udp glucuronosyltransferase ugt1a1, phosphodiesterase pde5, fatty acid amide hydrolase, 5-lipoxygenase, cathepsin l, and cathepsin s [a32906]. r406 appears to inhibit a wide range of kinases at higher concentrations [a32906]. it is thought that inhibition of some of these targets may be responsible for the increase in blood pressure seen with fostamatinib."

DB12130,Lorlatinib,"Lorlatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).[L39905] In the EU, it is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC not previously treated with an ALK inhibitor, or whose disease has progressed after using either [alectinib] or [ceritinib], or [crizotinib] and at least one other ALK inhibitor.[L13580]","Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for up to 85% of lung cancer cases worldwide and remains a particularly difficult to treat condition [L4848]. The gene rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a genetic alteration that drives the development of NSCLC in a number of patients [A40079, A40080]. Ordinarily, ALK is a natural endogenous tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an important role in the development of the brain and elicits activity on various specific neurons in the nervous system [A40075, A40078, A40079].

Subsequnetly, lorlatinib is a kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and number of other tyrosine kinase receptor related targets including ROS1, TYK1, FER, FPS, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, FAK, FAK2, and ACK [FDA Label]. Lorlatinib demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors [FDA Label]. Moreover, lorlatinib possesses the capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to reach and treat progressive or worsening brain metastases as well [L4848, A40078]. The overall antitumor activity of lorlatinib in in-vivo models appears to be dose-dependent and correlated with the inhibition of ALK phosphorylation [FDA Label].

Although many ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients respond to initial tyrosine kinase therapies, such patients also often experience tumor progression [A40081]. Various clinical trials performed with lorlatinib, however, have demonstrated its utility  to effect tumor regression in ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients who experience tumor progression despite current use or having already used various first and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors like crizotinib, alectinib, or ceritinib [A40086].",Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ROS|ALK tyrosine kinase receptor,proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase ros|alk tyrosine kinase receptor,"lorlatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with alk-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).[l39905] in the eu, it is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with alk-positive advanced nsclc not previously treated with an alk inhibitor, or whose disease has progressed after using either [alectinib] or [ceritinib], or [crizotinib] and at least one other alk inhibitor.[l13580]","non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) accounts for up to 85% of lung cancer cases worldwide and remains a particularly difficult to treat condition [l4848]. the gene rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk) is a genetic alteration that drives the development of nsclc in a number of patients [a40079, a40080]. ordinarily, alk is a natural endogenous tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an important role in the development of the brain and elicits activity on various specific neurons in the nervous system [a40075, a40078, a40079].

DB12249,Stem bromelain,"The primary medical purpose for which stem bromelain (SB) is currently indicated for is the removal of eschar in adults with deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns [FDA Label].

Besides this official indication, however, it is also believed that SB may be used as a treatment for several other purposes as well, including cardiovascular health, osteoarthritis, autoimmunity, blood clotting, diarrhea, cancer, surgery, and debridement - although the specific mechanisms of action for these indications remain to be elucidated [A27198].","Stem bromelain is ultimately a mixture of a number of thiol endopeptidases and other elements including phosphatases, glucosidase, peroxidases, cellulases, glycoproteins, carbohydrates, and various protease inhibitors [A27198]. The many different substrates and reactions that these varied enzymes can catalyze results in a number of different and possible mechanisms of action.

Stem bromelain is currently principally used as a topical agent for debridement of necrotic tissue from wounds or second to third-degree burns [FDA Label, A27198]. As bromelain can contain escharase as one of its component enzymes, it is thought that various stem bromelain creams or gels can accelerate the healing process of wounds by facilitating the rapid removal of necrotic layers of dermis while preserving unburned/unharmed tissues [A27198] and/or perhaps by accelerating the recovery of blood perfusion in wound tissue, control the expression of TNF-alpha, and raise the expression of TGT-beta, as demonstrated in the pig animal model [A27198]. This kind of enzymatic debridement is ultimately preferred to surgical debridement as physical, surgical procedures are naturally painful, non-selective, and involve the possibility of repeat or excessive anesthesia and/or bleeding [A27198].

With regards to cardiovascular health, certain studies suggest that stem bromelain is capable of breaking down cholesterol plaques, eliciting a strong fibrinolytic activity, and inhibiting blood platelet aggregation - all of which protect against ischemia/reperfusion injury in skeletal muscle and minimize the risk of arterial thrombosis and embolism [A27198]. Additionally, stem bromelain has also been shown to attenuate allergic airway disease by altering CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations - an action that may be beneficial in treating human asthma or hypersensitivity disorders [A27198]. Finally, stem bromelain has also been used to induce cardioprotection against ischemia-reperfusion injury via the Akt/Foxo pathway in rat model myocardium [A27198].

In the treatment of osteoarthritis, it is believed that stem bromelain has analgesic properties which are thought to be the result of direct influence on pain mediators such as bradykinin [A27198]. In addition, various trials suggest that the medication could be useful in reducing swelling, bruising, and pain in women having surgery like episiotomy [A27198]. Moreover, stem bromelain may also be used for treating acute inflammation and sports injuries [A27198].

Furthermore, stem bromelain has also been studied as an adjuvant therapy for chronic inflammatory, malignant, and autoimmune diseases [A27198]. Certain in vitro experiments have demonstrated that stem bromelain can modulate surface adhesion molecules on T cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells and also cause the secretion of IL-1B, IL-6, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) via peripheral blood mononuclear cells [A27198]. The agent has also been able to block the Raf-1/extracellular-regulated-kinase-2 (ERK-2) pathways by preventing T cell signal transduction [A27198]. In particular however, treating cells with stem bromelain decreases the activation of CD4(+) T cells and reduces the expression of CD25 [A27198]. Additionally, there is also evidence to suggest that oral therapy with stem bromelain produces certain analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which is a particularly common autoimmune disease [A27198].

Stem bromelain also affects blood coagulation by increasing the serum fibrinolytic ability and by preventing the synthesis of fibrin, a protein involved in blood clotting [A27198]. In the rat animal model, the reduction of serum fibrinogen level seems to be dose-dependent when both prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time become markedly prolonged at higher concentrations of administered stem bromelain [A27198]. In vitro and in vivo studies also suggest stem bromelain can act as an effective fibrinolytic agent since it stimulates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, causing an increased fibrinolysis by degrading fibrin [A27198].

In terms of potential antimicrobial effects of stem bromelain, there are varying observations regarding its specific mechanism of action [A27198]. When counteracting the effects of some intestinal pathogens like Vibrio cholera or Escherichia coli (whose enterotoxin causes diarrhea in animals), some studies suggest that stem bromelain interacts with intestinal secretory signaling pathways like adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphatase, guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphatase, and/or calcium-dependent signaling cascades [A27198]. Conversely, other studies propose that stem bromelain supplementation can lead to antiadhesion effects which prevent E. coli bacteria from attaching to particular glycoprotein receptors on the intestinal mucosa by proteolytically modifying those receptor attachment sites [A27198].

Additionally, various studies have shown that stem bromelain also possesses anticancer activity. In particular, the agent has been found to increase the expression of p53 and Bax in mouse skin, both of which are well-known apoptosis activators [A27198]. Stem bromelain can also evidently decrease the activity of cell survival regulators like Akt and Erk, therefore inducing apoptotic tumor cell death [A27198]. Finally, stem bromelain has also been observed to downregulate NF-kB and Cox-2 expression in mouse papillomas and in models of skin tumorigenesis [A27198]. It has also demonstrated the capability to inhibit bacterial endotoxin (LPS)-induced NF-kB activity as well as the expression of PGE2 and Cox-2 in human monocytic leukemia and murine microglial cell lines [A27198].",,,"the primary medical purpose for which stem bromelain (sb) is currently indicated for is the removal of eschar in adults with deep partial- and full-thickness thermal burns [fda label].

the proposed mechanism of action first involves the binding of the rs7 component to trop-2, which is highly expressed on the cell surface of multiple cancers.[a193671] binding of rs7 to trop-2 results in rapid internalization of bound antibody[a193656, a193659], and the likely intracellular release of sn-38 via hydrolysis of the cl2a linker[l13002, a193674]. sn-38 is an active metabolite of the anti-cancer drug [irinotecan], which is thought to work primarily through inhibition of dna topoisomerase i, leading to dna damage and eventual cell death.[a193665] in addition, recent work has identified a possible secondary mechanism of action for sn-38 by disrupting the binding of far upstream binding protein 1 (fubp1) to the _fuse_ elements regulating oncogene expression.[a193668]

DB13174,Rhein,No approved indication.,"**Liver: **The reversal of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease stems from rhien's lipid lowering and anti-obesity actions which result in an overall decrease in body weight, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein as well as its anti-inflammatory action [A19303]. The reversal of hepatic fibrosis is thought to be due to rhien's anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant action which suppresses the pro-fibrotic signalling from macrophages and further damage from reactive oxygen species respectively [A19304]. Ultimately this results in reduced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (Alpha-SMA) which is indicative of decreased hepatic stellate cell and myofibroblast activation. Rhein also appears to suppress the expression of transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta) 

**Kidney: **The protection from fibrosis in the kidney also appears to stem from rhien's anti-inflammatory action resulting in less inflammatory cell infiltration along with suppression of alpha-SMA and fibronectin expression [A19307]. These indicate a reduction in the activation of interstitial fibroblasts which are responsible for excess production of extracellular matrix components. Rhien may also suppress TGF-beta expression in the kidney. The anti-fibrotic mechanism of rhien may involve the upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 7 and hepatic growth factor [A19308]. In diabetic nephropathy rhein appears to suppress the expression of integrin-linked kinase leading to a reduction in the matrix metalloproteinase-9/tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ratio [A19311]. The improvement of epithelial tight junction function seems to involve upregulation of zona occludins protein-1 and occludin expression [A19310].

**Bone and joint:**Rhein reduces cartilage destruction by decreasing expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and -3 as well as upregulating tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases which serve to reduce the activity of several MMPs [A19339]. The anti-inflammatory action of rhein reduces the level of interleukin-1beta activity which plays a large role in reduction of extracellular matrix production, MMP activity, and continued inflammation [A19338]. Rhein reduces abnormal osteoblast synthetic activity through an unknown mechanism [A19337].

**Lipid lowering and anti-obesity: **Rhein is known to bind and inhibit liver X receptor alpha and beta with Kd values of 46.7 microM and 31.97 microM respectively [A19315]. This decreases the expression of genes such as that of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBP1c) and its downstream genes for fatty acid synthase (FAS), steroyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1), and acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1). SREBP1c, FAS, SCD1, and ACC1 are all involved in adipogenesis and their suppression results in less fat content. The genes for ABCA1 and ABCG1 are also suppressed. These correspond to cholesterol efflux trasporters and likely explain the reductiion in HDL and LDL seen with rhein. The inhibition of LXR by rhien relieves the inhibition on uncoupling protein 1 expression in brown adipose tissue. The result of this is increased thermogenesis which likely plays a role in the reduction of body weight produced by rhien. Additionally, rhein may downregulate peroxisome proliferator-receptor gamma and its downstream genes to inhibit adipocyte differentiation [A19314].

**Anti-oxidant/Pro-oxidant:** The antoxidant mechanism is unknown. The pro-oxidant action of rhien may involve the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex 1 and subsequent facilitation of NADH and NADPH dependent lipid peroxidation [A19323].

**Anti-cancer:** The exact mechanism of rhein's ability to damage DNA and supress the expression of DNA repair enzymes ADR and MGMT is unknown [A19340]. The mechanism through which rhien induces ER stress is unknown but likely involves its pro-oxidant properties [A19341]. Rhein has been observed to produce increases in cytosolic calcium, reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins as well as leakage of cytochrome C which would induce apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. The reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 serves to prevent extra cellular matrix breakdown by cancer cells and hinders their invasion into surrounding tissue [A19342]. Rhein also decreases vascular endothelial growth factor expression through an unknown mechanism to prevent cancer cells from stimulating agiogenesis. Rhein reduces the activity of the nuclear factor kappa (NFkappaB) pathway by preventing the destruction of IKBalpha [A19342] [A19345]. The activity of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway is also reduced by rhien [A19343]. Rhein's inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (particularly those involving extracellular signal regulated kinase) appears to follow a U-shaped dose response curve. ERK phosphorylation is inhibited at low concentrations of around 3microM but activated at higher concentrations of around 30microM [A19344]. Furthermore, ERK phosporylation is again inhibited at extremely high concentrations in excess of 100 microM [A19342]. The suppression of these three pathways is likely involved in the anti-proliferative effects of rhein.

**Anti-inflammatory:** The mechanism of rhein's anti-inflammatory effect likely involves its inhibition of the NFkappa B pathway which plays a role in the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [A19342] [A19345]. Rhein's anti-oxidant activity may also play a role in preventing damage during inflammation.

**Anti-diabetic:** Rhein is thought to increase islet beta cell survival by suppressing the expression of dynamin-related protein 1 and thereby preventing mitochondrial fission [A19288]. Rhein's anti-oxidant properties are also thought to play a role in protecting islet beta cells. The reduction in plasma glucose is likely due to increased survival of islet beta cells and subsequent increases in insulin secretion. Rhein's anti-inflammatory action may also serve to reduce insulin resistance.

**Anti-microbial:** Rhien inhibits H. pylori arylamine N-acetyltransferase in a dose dependent manner [A19312]. The mechanism of rhein's anti-microbial effect on H. pylori and S. aureus are unknown.

**Anti-allergenic:** Rhien inhibits 5-lipoxygenase with an IC50 of 13.7microM [A19329]. Rhien also inhibits mast cell degranulation although the specific mechanism is unknown.",Heat shock protein HSP 90-alpha|Oxysterols receptor LXR-alpha|Oxysterols receptor LXR-beta|Arylamine N-acetyltransferase|Polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase,heat shock protein hsp 90-alpha|oxysterols receptor lxr-alpha|oxysterols receptor lxr-beta|arylamine n-acetyltransferase|polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase,no approved indication.,"**liver: **the reversal of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease stems from rhien's lipid lowering and anti-obesity actions which result in an overall decrease in body weight, high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein as well as its anti-inflammatory action [a19303]. the reversal of hepatic fibrosis is thought to be due to rhien's anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant action which suppresses the pro-fibrotic signalling from macrophages and further damage from reactive oxygen species respectively [a19304]. ultimately this results in reduced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-sma) which is indicative of decreased hepatic stellate cell and myofibroblast activation. rhein also appears to suppress the expression of transforming growth factor-beta (tgf-beta) 

**kidney: **the protection from fibrosis in the kidney also appears to stem from rhien's anti-inflammatory action resulting in less inflammatory cell infiltration along with suppression of alpha-sma and fibronectin expression [a19307]. these indicate a reduction in the activation of interstitial fibroblasts which are responsible for excess production of extracellular matrix components. rhien may also suppress tgf-beta expression in the kidney. the anti-fibrotic mechanism of rhien may involve the upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 7 and hepatic growth factor [a19308]. in diabetic nephropathy rhein appears to suppress the expression of integrin-linked kinase leading to a reduction in the matrix metalloproteinase-9/tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ratio [a19311]. the improvement of epithelial tight junction function seems to involve upregulation of zona occludins protein-1 and occludin expression [a19310].

**bone and joint:**rhein reduces cartilage destruction by decreasing expression of matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-1 and -3 as well as upregulating tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases which serve to reduce the activity of several mmps [a19339]. the anti-inflammatory action of rhein reduces the level of interleukin-1beta activity which plays a large role in reduction of extracellular matrix production, mmp activity, and continued inflammation [a19338]. rhein reduces abnormal osteoblast synthetic activity through an unknown mechanism [a19337].

**lipid lowering and anti-obesity: **rhein is known to bind and inhibit liver x receptor alpha and beta with kd values of 46.7 microm and 31.97 microm respectively [a19315]. this decreases the expression of genes such as that of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (srebp1c) and its downstream genes for fatty acid synthase (fas), steroyl-coenzyme a desaturase 1 (scd1), and acetyl coa carboxylase 1 (acc1). srebp1c, fas, scd1, and acc1 are all involved in adipogenesis and their suppression results in less fat content. the genes for abca1 and abcg1 are also suppressed. these correspond to cholesterol efflux trasporters and likely explain the reductiion in hdl and ldl seen with rhein. the inhibition of lxr by rhien relieves the inhibition on uncoupling protein 1 expression in brown adipose tissue. the result of this is increased thermogenesis which likely plays a role in the reduction of body weight produced by rhien. additionally, rhein may downregulate peroxisome proliferator-receptor gamma and its downstream genes to inhibit adipocyte differentiation [a19314].

**anti-oxidant/pro-oxidant:** the antoxidant mechanism is unknown. the pro-oxidant action of rhien may involve the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex 1 and subsequent facilitation of nadh and nadph dependent lipid peroxidation [a19323].

**anti-cancer:** the exact mechanism of rhein's ability to damage dna and supress the expression of dna repair enzymes adr and mgmt is unknown [a19340]. the mechanism through which rhien induces er stress is unknown but likely involves its pro-oxidant properties [a19341]. rhein has been observed to produce increases in cytosolic calcium, reductions in mitochondrial membrane potential, and upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins as well as leakage of cytochrome c which would induce apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway. the reduction of matrix metalloproteinase-9 serves to prevent extra cellular matrix breakdown by cancer cells and hinders their invasion into surrounding tissue [a19342]. rhein also decreases vascular endothelial growth factor expression through an unknown mechanism to prevent cancer cells from stimulating agiogenesis. rhein reduces the activity of the nuclear factor kappa (nfkappab) pathway by preventing the destruction of ikbalpha [a19342] [a19345]. the activity of the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/akt pathway is also reduced by rhien [a19343]. rhein's inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (particularly those involving extracellular signal regulated kinase) appears to follow a u-shaped dose response curve. erk phosphorylation is inhibited at low concentrations of around 3microm but activated at higher concentrations of around 30microm [a19344]. furthermore, erk phosporylation is again inhibited at extremely high concentrations in excess of 100 microm [a19342]. the suppression of these three pathways is likely involved in the anti-proliferative effects of rhein.

**anti-inflammatory:** the mechanism of rhein's anti-inflammatory effect likely involves its inhibition of the nfkappa b pathway which plays a role in the production of many pro-inflammatory cytokines [a19342] [a19345]. rhein's anti-oxidant activity may also play a role in preventing damage during inflammation.

Reports have shown that insulin resistance plays a key role in the clinical development of PCOS.

DB13615,Mifamurtide,"Indicated in children, adolescents and young adults for the treatment of high-grade, resectable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection, typically in combination with post-operative multi-agent chemotherapy [L1203].","It was discovered that tumor necrosis could be promoted by factors released by the host’s immune system (e.g. macrophages) in response to the endotoxins or bacterial products [A31745]. Mifamurtide is referred to as MTP-PE or L-MTP-PE (in case of the liposomal formulation), which is a fully synthetic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif within the peptidoglycan polymer in the cell wall of bacteria. 

MDP stimulates the immune system by being recognized by different pattern recognition molecules and receptors, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 receptor and toll-like receptor (TLR). Similarly, mifamurtide acts as a ligand for TRL4 and NOD2. Involved in the innate immunity, NOD2 is an intracellular MDP sensor that is primarily expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. It possesses an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain, which is required to trigger nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signaling [A31745]. Activation of intracellular signaling transduction pathway NF-κB can promote inflammation and release of antimicrobial peptides, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-α, and other molecules such as chemokines and adhesion molecules [A31745]. Upon binding to TLR4, mifamurtide may activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and adaptor protein (AP)-1 [A31744]. Mifamurtide may also activate NLRP3, which is an essential component of the inflammasome, a protein complex that promotes the cleavage of procaspase 1 into its active form. Active caspase 1 further activates pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β [A31745]. Furthermore, mifamurtide induces the expression of adhesion molecules including lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR [A31744]. Mifamurtide may interact with interferon (IFN)-γ to up-regulate tumoricidal activity [A31744].

Upon intravenous administration, lipophilic mifamurtide is selectively phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages followed by subsequent degradation of liposomal vesicles by the phagocytic cells. Then, MTP-PE is released into the cytosol where it interacts with Nod2 and activates the macrophages and monocytes [A31744]. Mifamurtide exerts a tumoricidal action via the same signalling pathway as MDP but with greater superiority because the lipophilic properties of MTP-PE cause higher cell uptake via passive transfer through the cytoplasmic membrane [A31744]. Incorporation of MTP-PE into liposomal structures allows better safety profile and more efficient distribution to the liver, spleen, and lungs after intravenous administration [A31744].",Toll-like receptor 4|Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2,toll-like receptor 4|nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2,"indicated in children, adolescents and young adults for the treatment of high-grade, resectable, non-metastatic osteosarcoma after macroscopically complete surgical resection, typically in combination with post-operative multi-agent chemotherapy [l1203].","it was discovered that tumor necrosis could be promoted by factors released by the host’s immune system (e.g. macrophages) in response to the endotoxins or bacterial products [a31745]. mifamurtide is referred to as mtp-pe or l-mtp-pe (in case of the liposomal formulation), which is a fully synthetic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (mdp), which is a motif within the peptidoglycan polymer in the cell wall of bacteria.

DB13853,Anethole trithione,"The most typical uses for which anethol trithione is currently indicated for includes increasing salivary secretion in patients experiencing dry mouth or being used as an adjunctive therapy for cholecystitis, gallstone, indigestion, and acute/chronic hepatitis [A32614, A32616, L2377].

In addition, although some studies have suggested that anethol trithione also possesses a certain capacity to inhibit tumorigenesis as a potential cancer therapy medication, the specific mechanism of action for this effect remains to be elucidated [A32619] with certain national cancer institutes listing the agent as 'a substance that is being studied in the treatment of cancer' [L2373].","Epidemiological studies demonstrate that the prevalence of xerostomia and salivary gland hypofunction (SGH) rises with age, and is largely associated with medications and health [A32620]. In particular, anethole trithione (ATT) is believed to cause an increase in salivary secretion by upregulating the number of muscarinic receptor (whose stimulation is known to increase salivary secretion) sites on the salivary acinar cells [A32618, A32620, A32621]. Moreover, the combination use of ATT and pilocarpine is also thought to be effective in a synergistic manner - as ATT increases the number of cell surface receptors on salivary acinar cells, the pilocarpine, which is a parasympathetic agent, stimulates the newly formed receptors [A32620, A32621].

In addition, studies have also shown that the administration of ATT can also enhance the upregulation and release of substance P and alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide [A32617]. As receptors for peptides like alpha-calcitonin gene-related peptide are found throughout the body, the increase in these such proteins may modulate a variety of physiological functions in various body systems, even in the gastrointestinal or salivary actions [A32617]. Regardless, it has been shown that the use of ATT in patients can cause an increase in salivary flow rate in patients with xerostomia caused by senile hypofunction, medication side effects, and oral cancer therapy [A27165] and has been indicated for use in treating xerostomia associated with conditions like Sjogren's syndrome [A32618]. Nevertheless, there exist also studies that suggest ATT is generally only effective in managing the symptoms of mild salivary gland hypofunction but is not particularly useful for treating severe salivary gland hypofunction or severe cases of Sjogren's syndrome [A32618, A32620].

ATT is also used as an adjunctive therapy for cholecystitis, gallstone, indigestion, and acute/chronic hepatitis in certain countries like France, Germany, and China [A32614, A32616]. With regards to this particular indication, it is believed that ATT can facilitate raises in the level of glutathione in the liver, and raises in the activity of glutamylcysteine synthetase, glutathione reductase, and glutathione S transferase [L2388]. All of these effects are consequently intimately involved in the cellular antioxidant activity of glutathione where glutamylcysteine synthetase is the first enzyme involved in the cellular glutathione biosynthesis pathway; where glutathione reductase is necessary for catalyzing the reduction of pathway intermediates to glutathione; and glutathione S transferase catalyze the conjugation of the reduced form of glutathione to xenobiotic substrates for the purpose of detoxification [L2388]. Finally, glutathione itself is an important antioxidant found in plants, animals, fungi, and some bacteria where it assists in preventing damage to cellular components caused by reactive oxygen species, free radicals, etc [L2388]. Taken altogether, these various actions are suitable for treating cholecystitis, gall stones, indigestion, and may be used in the assisting treatment of acute and chronic hepatosis.

Although the specific mechanism of action for which ATT is seemingly capable of inhibiting tumorigenesis to a certain degree remains to be elucidated, some potential plausible mechanisms have been discussed. One such potential mechanism suggests that ATT has the capability to alter the metabolism of carcinogens by increasing the rate of detoxification of carcinogens in target organs like the liver and colon, thereby decreasing the generation of carcinogen metabolites and reducing parent-carcinogen induced carcinogenesis by way of those agents [A32619]. And finally, a second potential mechanism proposes that ATT can strikingly increase the antioxidant activities of colonic and liver GST, NAD(P)H:QR, and UDP-GT, therefore eliciting a chemoprotective action [A32619].",Protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2,protein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 2,"the most typical uses for which anethol trithione is currently indicated for includes increasing salivary secretion in patients experiencing dry mouth or being used as an adjunctive therapy for cholecystitis, gallstone, indigestion, and acute/chronic hepatitis [a32614, a32616, l2377].

DB13854,Gamolenic acid,Indicated as a dietary supplement for over-the-counter uses.,"Once gamolenic acid (GLA) is absorbed and converted to dihomo-gamolenic acid (DGLA), circulating DGLA fatty acids are converted to several lipid mediators with predominantly anti-inflammatory properties, such as prostaglandin-E1 (PGE1) and 15-HETrE. The anti-inflammatory effects of DGLA are attributed to both the anti-inflammatory properties of DGLA-derived metabolites and the ability of DGLA and its products to compete with arachidonic acid (AA) in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory potent eicosanoid products, such as prostaglandins, thromboxane and leukotrienes [A32848]. Both PGE1 and 15-HETrE are known to suppress inflammation, promote vasodilation, lower blood pressure, inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, inhibit platelet aggregation, and exert anti-neoplastic activities [A32848]. PGE1 is a potent vasodilator that binds to surface receptors on smooth muscle cells, increasing intracellular cAMP [F27]. PGE1 is binds to G protein coupled surface PGE (EP) receptors and prostacyclin (IP) receptors as a natural ligand [A32849]. 

GLA is proposed to enhance calcium absorption, reduce excretion and increase calcium deposition in bone [A32862]. It is proposed that GLA may suppress tumor growth _in vivo_ by increasing the expression of E-cadherin, a cell-to-cell adhesion molecule that acts as a suppressor of metastasis. Another possible mechanism of tumour suppression is that GLA also reduces tumor-endothelium adhesion, which is a key factor in the establishment of distant metastases, partly by improving gap junction communication within the endothelium [A32849]. By targeting the inflammatory process involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy, GLA inhibits the expression of inflammatory mediators that tend be elevated in diabetes, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), thereby attenuates the recruitment and infiltration of monocytes or macrophages [A32850].",,,indicated as a dietary supplement for over-the-counter uses.,"once gamolenic acid (gla) is absorbed and converted to dihomo-gamolenic acid (dgla), circulating dgla fatty acids are converted to several lipid mediators with predominantly anti-inflammatory properties, such as prostaglandin-e1 (pge1) and 15-hetre. the anti-inflammatory effects of dgla are attributed to both the anti-inflammatory properties of dgla-derived metabolites and the ability of dgla and its products to compete with arachidonic acid (aa) in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory potent eicosanoid products, such as prostaglandins, thromboxane and leukotrienes [a32848]. both pge1 and 15-hetre are known to suppress inflammation, promote vasodilation, lower blood pressure, inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, inhibit platelet aggregation, and exert anti-neoplastic activities [a32848]. pge1 is a potent vasodilator that binds to surface receptors on smooth muscle cells, increasing intracellular camp [f27]. pge1 is binds to g protein coupled surface pge (ep) receptors and prostacyclin (ip) receptors as a natural ligand [a32849].

Following irradiation, aloe polysaccharides block the upregulation of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax, and Bad while blocking downregulating anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [A32473]. _In vivo_, aloe polysaccharides may act as a scavenger for oxygen free radicals including DPPH, alkyl radicals, superoxides, and singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals that may also be generated by superoxides [A32470, A32476]. Hydrogen peroxide, which is a weak initiate lipid peroxidation, may also be effectively scavenged by aloe polysaccharides [A32476]. In a Fenton reaction system, aloe polysaccharides demonstrated a concentration-dependent scavenging activity against hydroxyl radical that were generated during the reaction [A32476]. Aloe polysaccharides may also compete with oxygen to react with nitric oxide (NO), thereby inhibiting the generation of nitrite and peroxynitrite anions that act as free radicals [A32476]. 

Findings from a study investigating the effects of aloe polysaccharides on doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress suggest that aloe polysaccharides mediate potent antioxidant actions _in vivo_ [A32476]. Doxorubicin, known to generate reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxy radicals, was administered to albino rats. This led to myocardial oxidative stress and cardiac injury accompanied by leakage of LDH and CPK from cardiac myocytes and to serum due to lipid peroxidation of cardiac membranes, reduced levels of antioxidant coenzyme GSH, and increased levels of SOD from a compensatory and combative mechanism of oxidative stress [A32476]. Treatment with aloe polysaccharides resulted in a significant decrease in serum LDH and CPK levels, indicating that aloe polysaccharides are capable in stabilizing cardiac membranes from peroxidative damage.

Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter’s syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH) [F1941].",Androgen receptor|Estrogen receptor|Mineralocorticoid receptor,androgen receptor|estrogen receptor|mineralocorticoid receptor,"testosterone enanthate in males is indicated as a replacement therapy in conditions associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone. some of the treated conditions are 1) primary hypogonadism, defined as testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion, orchitis, vanishing testis syndrome or orchidectomy; 2) hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to an idiopathic gonadotropin or luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency or due to a pituitary-hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation, in this case it is important to accompany the treatment with adrenal cortical and thyroid hormone replacement therapy; 3) to stimulate puberty in patients with delayed puberty not secondary to a pathological disorder. if the conditions 1 and 2 occur prior to puberty, the androgen replacement therapy will be needed during adolescent years for the development of secondary sexual characteristics and prolonged androgen treatment might be needed it to maintain sexual characteristics after puberty.[fda label]

in females, testosterone enanthate is indicated to be used secondarily in presence of advanced inoperable metastatic mammary cancer in women who are from one to five years postmenopausal. it has also been used in premenopausal women with breast cancer who have benefited from oophorectomy and are considered to have a hormone-responsive tumor.[fda label]

testosterone enanthate injections that are currently formulated for subcutaneous use are specifically indicated only for primary hypogonadism and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [f1941]. the use of such formulations is limited because the safety and efficacy of these subcutaneous products in adult males with late-onset hypogonadism and males less than 18 years old have not yet been established [f1941]. moreover, subcutaneously administered testosterone enanthate is indicated only for the treatment of men with hypogonadal conditions associated with structural or genetic etiologies, considering the medication could cause blood pressure increases that can raise the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events like non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death [f1941].","the effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as dht), and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. free testosterone (t) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&alpha;-dihydrotestosterone (dht) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&alpha;-reductase. dht binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than t, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of t. the t-receptor or dht-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal dna. the areas of binding are called hormone response elements (hres), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing androgen effects.[a950]

such activities are useful as endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics [f1941]. these effects include the growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution [f1941].

male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies [f1941]. primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as klinefelter’s syndrome or leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (fsh, lh) [f1941]."

DB13961,Fish oil,"Under FDA approval, fish oil pharmaceuticals are typically products consisting of a combination of the omega-3-fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and are indicated primarily as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adult patients with severe (>=500 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia [FDA Label, F36].

Under EMA approval, such fish oil pharmaceuticals comprised of virtually the same fish and fish oil derived omega-3-fatty acids EPA and DHA are indicated specifically for (a) adjuvant treatment in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, in addition to other standard therapy (ie. statins, antiplatelet medicinal products, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors), and (b) as a supplement to diet when dietary measures alone are insufficient to produce an adequate response, particularly with type IV hypertriglyceridemia in monotherapy or type IIb/III in combination with statins, when control of triglycerides is insufficient [L2661]. In addition, prescribing information for EMA approved fish oil pharmaceuticals are also indicated as an adjunct to diet to reduce very high (>=500 mg/dL) triglyceride levels in adult patients, much like similar FDA approved indications [F37, FDA Label].","The specific mechanism of action by which the fish oil EPA and DHA acids are capable of reducing serum triglyceride levels is not yet fully understood [FDA Label, A32933]. Nevertheless, it is proposed that such omega-3-fatty acids may not be the preferred substrates of the enzyme diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase that participates in the generation of triglycerides; that  they might interact with nuclear transcription factors that manage lipogenesis; or that their presence and increase in levels can cause cellular metabolism to subsequently shift toward a decrease in triglyceride synthesis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation [A32933]. Moreover, the EPA and DHA acids are also believed to be able to promote apolipoprotein B degradation in the liver through the stimulation of an autophagic process [A32933]. It may also be possible that these fish oil acids can accelerate the clearance of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles and chylomicron [A32933]. The combination of all these actions results in fewer VLDL particles being assembled and secreted, which is of considerable importance as VLDL particles are the major endogenous source of triglycerides [A32933].

Moreover, new paradigms of how inflammation is contained and dissipated involve various newly discovered chemical mediators, resolvins, and protectins [A32933]. Such agents are believed to be directly involved in blocking neutrophil migration, infiltration, recruitment, as well as blocking T-cell migration and promoting T-cell apoptosis [A32933]. Additionally, such protectins can also reduce tumor necrosis factor and interferon secretion [A32933]. Of particular importance, however, is the fact that protectins and resolvins are exclusively derived from omega-3-fatty acids and that EPA is the substrate of the resolvins family and DHA can be converted to both resolvins and protectins [A32933]. It is believed that these effects of such fish oil acids underlie the actions that fish oil have demonstrated on eliciting stability for vulnerable inflammatory plaques [A32933].

Finally, fish oil acids have demonstrated certain direct electrophysiological effects on the myocardium [A32933]. In animal studies, it was shown that the ventricular fibrillation threshold could be increased in both animals fed or infused with omega-3-fatty acids [A32933]. Further studies subsequently revealed that such fatty acids could reduce both sodium currents and L-type calcium currents on a cellular and ion channel level [A32933]. It is consequently hypothesized that during ischemia, a reduction in the sodium ion current protects hyperexcitable tissue, and a reduction in the calcium ion current could reduce arrhythmogenic depolarizing currents - and that perhaps the use of EPA and DHA fish oil acids could facilitate such activity [A32933].

The therapeutic activity of black cohosh was initially believed to be the activation of estrogen receptors; however, more recent studies show that although some components of the extract bind to at least one subtype of estrogen receptor, the receptor binding produces very little (if any) estrogenic effect, and may selectively block some of the effects.[L2302]

An early study reported that treatment with black cohosh leads to a decrease in luteinizing hormone (LH) levels consistent with its purported estrogenic effect. Despite this, more recent studies have shown no effect on levels of LH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), or prolactin.

The natural ligand of SSRTs, somatostatin, is a potent inhibitory regulator of pituitary and gastrointestinal hormone release and proliferation [A31705]. Advanced and well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors express high levels of somatostatin receptors, especially somatostatin recetor type 2 (SSRT2), [A31706] and have the ability to incorporate amines intracellularly and decarboxylate them [A31707]. 

As an analogue of somatostatin, Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate binds to somatostatin receptor with highest binding affinity for SSRT2.

DB14001,alpha-Tocopherol succinate,"The primary health-related use for which alpha-tocopherol succinate is formally indicated is as a dietary supplement for patients who demonstrate a genuine vitamin E deficiency. At the same time, vitamin E deficiency is generally quite rare but may occur in premature babies of very low birth weight (< 1500 grams), individuals with fat-malabsorption disorders (as fat is required for the digestive tract to absorb vitamin E), or individuals with abetalipoproteinemia - a rare, inherited disorder that causes poor absorption of dietary fat - who require extremely large doses of supplemental vitamin E daily (around 100 mg/kg or 5-10 g/day) [L2120]. In all such cases, alpha-tocopherol is largely the preferred form of vitamin E to be administered.

Elsewhere, vitamin E's chemical profile as a fat-soluble antioxidant that is capable of neutralizing free radicals in the body continues to generate ongoing interest and study regarding how and whether or not the vitamin can help prevent or delay various chronic diseases associated with free radicals or other potential biological effects that vitamin E possesses like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, ocular conditions, immune illnesses, cancer, and more [T166]. None of these ongoing studies have yet to elucidate any formally significant evidence, however [T166].

Similarly, more effective clinical trials are necessary to confirm what has only been accrued as preliminary data when it comes to studies proposing the demonstration of alpha-tocopherol succinate's capability to act as an anti-cancer therapy or as a regulator of inflammation [L2699, A32958, A32959].","Without further evidence to suggest otherwise, alpha-tocpherol succinate is generally believed to undergo a logical de-esterification in the gastrointestinal tract before being subsequently absorbed as free tocopherol [A32956, A32957]. The free alpha-tocopherol is therefore available and capable of the following activities.

Vitamin E's antioxidant capabilities are perhaps the primary biological action associated with alpha-tocopherol. In general, antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that consist of an unshared electron [L2120]. These unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) [L2120]. In doing so, free radicals are capable of damaging cells, which may facilitate their contribution to the development of various diseases [L2120]. Moreover, the human body naturally forms ROS when it converts food into energy and is also exposed to environmental free radicals contained in cigarette smoke, air pollution, or ultraviolet radiation from the sun [L2120]. It is believed that perhaps vitamin E antioxidants might be able to protect body cells from the damaging effects of such frequent free radical and ROS exposure [L2120].

Specifically, vitamin E is a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation of free radical reactions [T166]. The vitamin E molecule is specifically a peroxyl radical scavenger and especially protects polyunsaturated fatty acids within endogenous cell membrane phospholipids and plasma lipoproteins [T166]. Peroxyl free radicals react with vitamin E a thousand times more rapidly than they do with the aforementioned polyunsaturated fatty acids [T166]. Furthermore, the phenolic hydroxyl group of tocopherol reacts with an organic peroxyl radical to form an organic hydroperoxide and tocopheroxyl radical [T166]. This tocopheroxyl radical can then undergo various possible reactions: it could (a) be reduced by other antioxidants to tocopherol, (b) react with another tocopheroxyl radical to form non-reactive products like tocopherol dimers, (c) undergo further oxidation to tocopheryl quinone, or (d) even act as a prooxidant and oxidize other lipids [T166].

In addition to the antioxidant actions of vitamin E, there have been a number of studies that report various other specific molecular functions associated with vitamin E [T166]. For example, alpha-tocopherol is capable of inhibiting protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes [T166]. In particular, protein kinase C inhibition by alpha-tocopherol is partially attributable to its attenuating effect on the generation of membrane-derived dialglycerol, a lipid that facilitates protein kinase C translocation, thereby increasing its activity [T166].

In addition, vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium [T166].

Vitamin E also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase-1 [T166]. The increased expression of these two rate-limiting enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade explains the observation that vitamin E, in a dose-dependent fashion, enhanced the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans [T166].

Furthermore, vitamin E can inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation, and platelet release reactions [T166]. The vitamin can also evidently inhibit the plasma generation of thrombin, a potent endogenous hormone that binds to platelet receptors and induces aggregation of platelets [T166]. Moreover, vitamin E may also be able to decrease monocyte adhesion to the endothellium by downregulating expression of adhesion molecules and decreasing monocyte superoxide production [T166].

Given these proposed biological activities of vitamin E, the substance continues to generate ongoing interest and studies in whether or not vitamin E can assist in delaying or preventing various diseases with any one or more of its biologic actions. For instance, studies continue to see whether vitamin E's ability to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation can aid in preventing the development of cardiovascular disease or atherogenesis [T166].

Similarly, it is also believed that if vitamin E can decrease the chance of cardiovascular disease then it can also decrease the chance of related diabetic disease and complications [T166]. In much the same way, it is also believed that perhaps the antioxidant abilities of vitamin E can neutralize free radicals that are constantly reacting and damaging cellular DNA [T166]. Furthermore, it is also believed that free radical damage does contribute to protein damage in the ocular lens - another free radical-mediated condition that may potentially be prevented by vitamin E use [T166]. Where it is also suggested that various central nervous system disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and Tardive Dyskinesia possess some form of oxidative stress component, it is also proposed that perhaps vitamin E use could assist with its antioxidant action [T166].

There have also been studies that report the possibility of vitamin E supplementation can improve or reverse the natural decline in cellular immune function in healthy, elderly individuals [T166].

As of this time, however, there is either only insufficient data or even contradicting data (where certain doses of vitamin E supplementation could even potentially increase all-cause mortality) [A237] on which to suggest the use of vitamin E could formally benefit in any of these proposed indications.

Furthermore, there are ongoing studies that demonstrate alpha-tocopherol succinate's unique possession of capabilities that allow it to induce differentiation, inhibit proliferation and apoptosis in cancer cells, enhance the growth-inhibitory effect of ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, and some chemotherapeutic agents and biological response modifiers on tumor cells, all the while protecting normal cells against any adverse effects [A32959]. Despite being able to demonstrate such effects on animal and human cells in culture, the value of these effects has not drawn significant attention from researchers and clinicians and nor has the specific mechanisms of action been elucidated [A32959]. Additionally, other studies have also shown that alpha-tocopherol succinate seemingly possesses an ability exclusive from other tocopherol esters to inhibit and minimize prostaglandin E2 production in human lung epithelial cells [A32958]. Considering increased prostaglandin E2 production has been observed frequently in lung cancer patients, there may be another avenue in which alpha-tocopherol succinate may be able to treat lung cancer [A32958].

Although all forms of Vitamin E exhibit antioxidant activity, it is known that the antioxidant activity of vitamin E is not sufficient to explain the vitamin's biological activity. <br/>Vitamin E's anti-atherogenic activity involves the inhibition of the oxidation of LDL and the accumulation of oxLDL in the arterial wall. It also appears to reduce oxLDL-induced apoptosis in human endothelial cells. Oxidation of LDL is a key early step in atherogenesis as it triggers a number of events which lead to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition, vitamin E inhibits protein kinase C (PKC) activity. PKC plays a role in smooth muscle cell proliferation, and, thus, the inhibition of PKC results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, which is involved in atherogenesis. <br/>Vitamin E's antithrombotic and anticoagulant activities involves the downregulation of the expression of intracellular cell adhesion molecule(ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule(VCAM)-1 which lowers the adhesion of blood components to the endothelium. In addition, vitamin E upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 which in turn enhances the release of prostacyclin. Prostacyclin is a vasodilating factor and inhibitor of platelet aggregation and platelet release. It is also known that platelet aggregation is mediated by a mechanism involving the binding of fibrinogen to the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complex of platelets. GPIIb/IIIa is the major membrane receptor protein that is key to the role of the platelet aggregation response. GPIIb is the alpha-subunit of this platelet membrane protein. Alpha-tocopherol downregulates GPIIb promoter activity which results in reduction of GPIIb protein expression and decreased platelet aggregation. Vitamin E has also been found in culture to decrease plasma production of thrombin, a protein which binds to platelets and induces aggregation. A metabolite of vitamin E called vitamin E quinone or alpha-tocopheryl quinone (TQ) is a potent anticoagulant. This metabolite inhibits vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, which is a major enzyme in the coagulation cascade.<br/>The neuroprotective effects of vitamin E are explained by its antioxidant effects. Many disorders of the nervous system are caused by oxidative stress. Vitamin E protects against this stress, thereby protecting the nervouse system. <br/>The immunomodulatory effects of Vitamin E have been demonstrated in vitro, where alpha-tocopherol increases mitogenic response of T lymphocytes from aged mice. The mechanism of this response by vitamin E is not well understood, however it has been suggested that vitamin E itself may have mitogenic activity independent of its antioxidant activity. <br/>Lastly, the mechanism of action of vitamin E's antiviral effects (primarily against HIV-1) involves its antioxidant activity. Vitamin E reduces oxidative stress, which is thought to contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, as well as to the pathogenesis of other viral infections. Vitamin E also affects membrane integrity and fluidity and, since HIV-1 is a membraned virus, altering membrane fluidity of HIV-1 may interfere with its ability to bind to cell-receptor sites, thus decreasing its infectivity.",SEC14-like protein 3|SEC14-like protein 2|Nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2|Protein kinase C beta type|Polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase|Protein kinase C alpha type,sec14-like protein 3|sec14-like protein 2|nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group i member 2|protein kinase c beta type|polyunsaturated fatty acid 5-lipoxygenase|protein kinase c alpha type,"_in addition to any following information, owing to d-alpha-tocopherol acetate's closely related chemical nature with alpha-tocopherol acetate, please also refer to the drug information page for alpha-tocopherol acetate for further data._

elsewhere, vitamin e's chemical profile as a fat-soluble antioxidant that is capable of neutralizing free radicals in the body continues to generate ongoing interest and study regarding how and whether or not the vitamin can help prevent or delay various chronic diseases associated with free radicals or other potential biological effects that vitamin e possesses like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, ocular conditions, immune illnesses, cancer, and more [t166]. none of these ongoing studies have yet to elucidate any formally significant evidence, however [t166].","vitamin e's antioxidant capabilities are perhaps the primary biological action associated with alpha-tocopherol. in general, antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that consist of an unshared electron [l2120]. these unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ros) [l2120]. in doing so, free radicals are capable of damaging cells, which may facilitate their contribution to the development of various diseases [l2120]. moreover, the human body naturally forms ros when it converts food into energy and is also exposed to environmental free radicals contained in cigarette smoke, air pollution, or ultraviolet radiation from the sun [l2120]. it is believed that perhaps vitamin e antioxidants might be able to protect body cells from the damaging effects of such frequent free radical and ros exposure [l2120].

specifically, vitamin e is a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation of free radical reactions [t166]. the vitamin e molecule is specifically a peroxyl radical scavenger and especially protects polyunsaturated fatty acids within endogenous cell membrane phospholipids and plasma lipoproteins [t166]. peroxyl free radicals react with vitamin e a thousand times more rapidly than they do with the aforementioned polyunsaturated fatty acids [t166]. furthermore, the phenolic hydroxyl group of tocopherol reacts with an organic peroxyl radical to form an organic hydroperoxide and tocopheroxyl radical [t166]. this tocopheroxyl radical can then undergo various possible reactions: it could (a) be reduced by other antioxidants to tocopherol, (b) react with another tocopheroxyl radical to form non-reactive products like tocopherol dimers, (c) undergo further oxidation to tocopheryl quinone, or (d) even act as a prooxidant and oxidize other lipids [t166].

in addition to the antioxidant actions of vitamin e, there have been a number of studies that report various other specific molecular functions associated with vitamin e [t166]. for example, alpha-tocopherol is capable of inhibiting protein kinase c activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes [t166]. in particular, protein kinase c inhibition by alpha-tocopherol is partially attributable to its attenuating effect on the generation of membrane-derived dialglycerol, a lipid that facilitates protein kinase c translocation, thereby increasing its activity [t166].

in addition, vitamin e enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (icam-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (vcam-1), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium [t166].

vitamin e also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase a2 and cyclooxygenase-1 [t166]. the increased expression of these two rate-limiting enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade explains the observation that vitamin e, in a dose-dependent fashion, enhanced the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans [t166].

furthermore, vitamin e can inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation, and platelet release reactions [t166]. the vitamin can also evidently inhibit the plasma generation of thrombin, a potent endogenous hormone that binds to platelet receptors and induces aggregation of platelets [t166]. moreover, vitamin e may also be able to decrease monocyte adhesion to the endothellium by downregulating expression of adhesion molecules and decreasing monocyte superoxide production [t166].

given these proposed biological activities of vitamin e, the substance continues to generate ongoing interest and studies in whether or not vitamin e can assist in delaying or preventing various diseases with any one or more of its biologic actions. for instance, studies continue to see whether vitamin e's ability to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation can aid in preventing the development of cardiovascular disease or atherogenesis [t166].

similarly, it is also believed that if vitamin e can decrease the chance of cardiovascular disease then it can also decrease the chance of related diabetic disease and complications [t166]. in much the same way, it is also believed that perhaps the antioxidant abilities of vitamin e can neutralize free radicals that are constantly reacting and damaging cellular dna [t166]. furthermore, it is also believed that free radical damage does contribute to protein damage in the ocular lens - another free radical-mediated condition that may potentially be prevented by vitamin e use [t166]. where it is also suggested that various central nervous system disorders like parkinson's disease, alzheimer's disease, down's syndrome, and tardive dyskinesia possess some form of oxidative stress component, it is also proposed that perhaps vitamin e use could assist with its antioxidant action [t166].

there have also been studies that report the possibility of vitamin e supplementation can improve or reverse the natural decline in cellular immune function in healthy, elderly individuals [t166].

as of this time however, there is either only insufficient data or even contradicting data (where certain doses of vitamin e supplementation could even potentially increase all-cause mortality) [a237] on which to suggest the use of vitamin e could formally benefit in any of these proposed indications."

DB14017,H3B-8800,,"H3B-8800 is thought to bind to a site similar to pladienolides on the SF3B complex within the spliceosome [A32749]. Once bound it induces increased retention of short (<300 nucleotide) GC-rich introns through modulation of pre-mRNA processing. These intron-retained mRNA sequences are then thought to be destroyed through the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. It has been suggested that modulation by H3B-8800 is mediated by disruption of branchpoint sequence recognition by the SF3B complex as there is overall less preference for adenosine as the branchpoint nucleotide and a greater amount of sequences with weaker association to the SFB3 in introns retained with H3B-8800.

It was found that 41 of 404 genes encoding spliceosome proteins contained GC-rich sequences whose retention was induced by H3B-8800 [A32749].

DB14487,Zinc acetate,"Zinc can be used for the treatment and prevention of zinc deficiency/its consequences, including stunted growth and acute diarrhea in children, and slowed wound healing. It is also utilized for boosting the immune system, treating the common cold and recurrent ear infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [L2172].","**Zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. The catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. For example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. It is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [L2096].

Zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [A32419].

In HL-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of A20 mRNA, which, via TRAF pathway, decreases NF-kappaB activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, and IL-8 [A32418].

There are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. Various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. Cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 September 2016 [L2106].

Zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of T-helper cells. T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [A32417].

The change of _Th(1)_ to _Th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (NK cell) and T cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [A32417]. 

In humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new CD4+ T cells, produced in the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production [A32417].

In another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [A32417]. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In such cells, zinc was found to induce A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. This process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [A32417].

The exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. However, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. Topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce P. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of P. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [L2102].","B1 bradykinin receptor|Methylated-DNA--protein-cysteine methyltransferase|Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A|Elongation factor 1-alpha

infections, as well as preventing lower respiratory tract infections [l2172].","**zinc has three primary biological roles**: _catalytic_, _structural_, and _regulatory_. the catalytic and structural role of zinc is well established, and there are various noteworthy reviews on these functions. for example, zinc is a structural constituent in numerous proteins, inclusive of growth factors, cytokines, receptors, enzymes, and transcription factors for different cellular signaling pathways. it is implicated in numerous cellular processes as a cofactor for approximately 3000 human proteins including enzymes, nuclear factors, and hormones [l2096].

zinc promotes resistance to epithelial apoptosis through cell protection (cytoprotection) against reactive oxygen species and bacterial toxins, likely through the antioxidant activity of the cysteine-rich metallothioneins [a32419].

in hl-60 cells (promyelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc enhances the up-regulation of a20 mrna, which, via traf pathway, decreases nf-kappab activation, leading to decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-1beta, and il-8 [a32418].

there are several mechanisms of action of zinc on acute diarrhea. various mechanisms are specific to the gastrointestinal system: zinc restores mucosal barrier integrity and enterocyte brush-border enzyme activity, it promotes the production of antibodies and circulating lymphocytes against intestinal pathogens, and has a direct effect on ion channels, acting as a potassium channel blocker of adenosine 3-5-cyclic monophosphate-mediated chlorine secretion. cochrane researchers examined the evidence available up to 30 september 2016 [l2106].

zinc deficiency in humans decreases the activity of serum _thymulin_ (a hormone of the thymus), which is necessary for the maturation of t-helper cells. t-helper 1 (th(1)) cytokines are decreased but t-helper 2 (th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans [a32417].

the change of _th(1)_ to _th(2)_ function leads to cell-mediated immune dysfunction. because il-2 production (th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this causes decreased activity of natural-killer-cell (nk cell) and t cytolytic cells, normally involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and malignant cells [a32417]. 

in humans, zinc deficiency may lead to the generation of new cd4+ t cells, produced in the thymus. in cell culture studies (hut-78, a th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) activation, phosphorylation of ikappab, and binding of nf-kappab to dna are decreased and this results in decreased th(1) cytokine production [a32417].

in another study, zinc supplementation in human subjects suppressed the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers [a32417]. in hl-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-8 cytokines and mrna. in such cells, zinc was found to induce a20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited nf-kappab activation by the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor pathway. this process decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers [a32417].

the exact mechanism of zinc in acne treatment is poorly understood. however, zinc is considered to act directly on microbial inflammatory equilibrium and facilitate antibiotic absorption when used in combination with other agents. topical zinc alone as well as in combination with other agents may be efficacious because of its anti-inflammatory activity and ability to reduce p. acnes bacteria by the inhibition of p. acnes lipases and free fatty acid levels [l2102]."
DB14500,Potassium,"**General uses of potassium**

Potassium is indicated to treat a variety of conditions. Firstly, it used to replenish potassium that has been depleted by conditions including but not limited to malabsorption, decreased intake, or excess sodium intake.  The causes of potassium deficiency are numerous. The following indications for potassium are not comprehensive, but include the main indications for which this nutrient is used. Various products and preparations contain potassium.

**Potassium chloride**

Potassium chloride is one of the main preparations of potassium used in a clinical setting. The oral solution is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hypokalemia presenting with or without metabolic alkalosis, in patients who have failed conservative management with potassium-rich foods or diuretic dose titrations.[L8744] The injection form of potassium chloride is indicated to replenish potassium in patients who are not feasible candidates for oral potassium. Highly concentrated potassium is intended for the treatment of potassium deficiency in fluid restricted individuals who cannot tolerate fluid volumes normally associated with injected potassium solutions that contain lower concentrations.[L8768]
Finally, the extended-release tablet preparation of potassium chloride is used to treat hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis, to treat digitalis intoxication, and to manage patients with hypokalemic familial periodic paralysis. It is also used in the prevention of hypokalemia in those who are at a high risk of negative clinical outcomes if hypokalemia occurs; patients on digitalis or those with cardiac arrhythmias would be at particular risk of negative outcomes.[L8771]


**Potassium chloride with dextrose and sodium chloride** 

This liquid preparation is is indicated in a clinical setting as a source of water, calories and electrolytes.[L8747] Potassium acetate solution is meant as an alternative to potassium chloride, replenishing potassium and added to large volume infusion fluids for intravenous injection.[L8759]

**Potassium citrate**

The potassium citrate preparation is used for the management of renal tubular acidosis (RTA) with calcium stones (nephrolithiasis); calcium oxalate stones by any cause, and uric acid nephrolithiasis (with or without calcium stones). This regimen also includes adequate water intake (leading to a urine out put of 2 L/day or more) and sodium restriction.[L8753]","Potassium ion is the primary intracellular cation found in virtually all body tissues.[L8771] The total amount of body potassium in adults is estimated at 45 millimole (mmol)/kg body weight (about 140 g for an adult weighing 175 pounds; 1 mmol = 1 milliequivalent or 39.1 mg of potassium). Potassium mainly stays in cells, and a small amount can be found in the extracellular fluid. The amount of potassium that stays in the cell (intracellular) is 30 times that of extracellular concentration, creating a transmembrane gradient, regulated by the sodium-potassium (Na+/K+) ATPase transporter. This is an important gradient for nerve conduction, muscle contractions, and renal function.[L2652] Vomiting, diarrhea, renal disease, medications, and other conditions that alter potassium excretion or shift it inside or outside of cells. In healthy patients individuals with normal renal function, markedly high or low potassium levels are rare.[L2652]

**Effect on blood pressure**

Potassium decreases reduces intravascular volume, by reducing sodium reabsorption through an increase in urinary sodium excretion. This short-term effect, however, does not explain the long-term effects of potassium on blood pressure. Increased plasma potassium levels that occur through intake are associated with vasodilation occurring via stimulation of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump (Na+/-K+ATPase) and opening of potassium channels of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase pump. Other possible mechanisms of action for potassium may include alterations in barroreflex sensitivity and hormone sensitivity in vascular smooth muscle and cells of the sympathetic nervous system.[A32167]

**Effect on electrolyte balance and body systems**

The potassium gradient across the membrane of a cell regulates cell membrane potential, maintained predominantly by the sodium-potassium (Na+/-K+ ATPase pump). Transmembrane electro-chemical gradients encourage diffusion of Na+ extracellularly and K+ intracellularly. Potassium supplementation prevents hypokalemia to maintain this balance and is often used in an oral solution or injection form in the clinical setting, preventing harmful effects such as arrhythmias, abnormal muscle function, and neurological disturbances.[A32167] When activated, the Na+/-K+ ATPase pump exchanges two extracellular K+ ions for three intracellular sodium (Na+) ions, impacting membrane potential via either  excitation or inhibition. This is especially important in the homeostasis of the nervous system, kidney, and cardiac muscle tissue. The body and cell distributions of potassium in normal conditions are known as internal and external balance, respectively.[A32222] Reduced serum potassium (or imbalance) increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).[A186173]",Sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase subunit alpha-1,sodium/potassium-transporting atpase subunit alpha-1,"**general uses of potassium**

The short isoform appears to be constitutively expressed, especially by lung and gut epithelial cells, while lfTSLP is upregulated in response to proinflammatory stimuli. While the role of sfTSLP is still unclear, lfTSLP has emerged as an upstream alarmin central to the pathophysiology of inflammatory disorders including asthma, atopic rhinitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, and atopic dermatitis.[A243764, A243769, A243774]

Under normal conditions, lfTSLP interacts with its cognate receptor TSLPR, and IL-7Rα in a ternary complex with three contact sites labelled site I (TSLP:TSLPR), site II (TSLP:IL-7Rα), and site III (TSLPR:IL-7Rα). The assembly of the ternary complex is stepwise, as TSLP does not interact appreciably with IL-7Rα until after it has bound TSLPR. Complementary electrostatic surfaces on TSLP and TSLPR mediate initial high affinity formation of a TSLP:TSLPR complex (_K_<sub>D</sub> of 32 nM and _k_<sub>a</sub> of 1.7 x 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). This initial binding induces a restructuring of the π-helical turn in the TSLP αA helix and structuring of the AB loop to facilitate binding of TSLP to a hydrophobic patch on IL-7Rα to form the ternary complex (_K_<sub>D</sub> of 29 nM and _k_<sub>a</sub> of 1.23 x 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>). The complete ternary complex is stabilized by additional interactions between TSLPR and IL-7Rα at site III near the transmembrane domain of each receptor.[A243779]

Formation of the ternary complex activates JAK1/2, which, through downstream pathways involving STAT3/5, NF-κB, PI3K, and MAPK, induces the expression of Th2 cytokines including IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-13.[A243764] TSLP can induce Th2 cytokine production by stimulating dendritic cells and ILC2 cells (primarily in T2 asthma). Furthermore, TSLP has been implicated in steroid resistance of ILC2 cells. In neutrophilic asthma, TSLP induces dendritic cells to drive the development of Th17 cells, which secrete IL-17A to recruit neutrophils and drive inflammation. In paucigranulocytic asthma, TSLP mediates cross-talk between mast cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Hence, despite different underlying pathways, TSLP appears to function as a critical upstream driver across asthma endotypes.[A243764, A243769, A243774]

As TSLP is incapable of binding IL-7Rα prior to its inclusion in the TSLP:TSLPR dimer, tezepelumab effectively blocks the assembly of the ternary complex and resulting downstream signalling.[A243779] Furthermore, unlike existing therapies that act on specific downstream effector molecules, targeting TSLP ensures effective upstream blockade and is expected to be efficacious against multiple asthma endotypes.[A243764, A243769, A243774]",Thymic stromal lymphopoietin,thymic stromal lymphopoietin,"tezepelumab is indicated as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma.[l39504,l44712] in europe, it is reserved for patients who are inadequately controlled despite maintenance treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another drug.[l44712]
