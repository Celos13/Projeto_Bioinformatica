   abstract = {Introduction: Drug repurposing provides a cost-effective strategy to re-use approved drugs for new medical indications. Several machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been developed for systematic identification of drug repurposing leads based on big data resources, hence further accelerating and de-risking the drug development process by computational means. Areas covered: The authors focus on supervised ML and AI methods that make use of publicly available databases and information resources. While most of the example applications are in the field of anticancer drug therapies, the methods and resources reviewed are widely applicable also to other indications including COVID-19 treatment. A particular emphasis is placed on the use of comprehensive target activity profiles that enable a systematic repurposing process by extending the target profile of drugs to include potent off-targets with therapeutic potential for a new indication. Expert opinion: The scarcity of clinical patient data and the current focus on genetic aberrations as primary drug targets may limit the performance of anticancer drug repurposing approaches that rely solely on genomics-based information. Functional testing of cancer patient cells exposed to a large number of targeted therapies and their combinations provides an additional source of repurposing information for tissue-aware AI approaches.},

   abstract = {Traditional drug discovery struggles to keep pace with the ever-evolving threat of infectious diseases. New viruses and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, all demand rapid solutions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising path forward through accelerated drug repurposing. AI allows researchers to analyze massive datasets, revealing hidden connections between existing drugs, disease targets, and potential treatments. This approach boasts several advantages. First, repurposing existing drugs leverages established safety data and reduces development time and costs. Second, AI can broaden the search for effective therapies by identifying unexpected connections between drugs and potential new targets. Finally, AI can help mitigate limitations by predicting and minimizing side effects, optimizing drugs for repurposing, and navigating intellectual property hurdles. The article explores specific AI strategies like virtual screening, target identification, structure base drug design and natural language processing. Real-world examples highlight the potential of AI-driven drug repurposing in discovering new treatments for infectious diseases.},

   abstract = {Drug repurposing—identifying new therapeutic uses for approved drugs—is often a serendipitous and opportunistic endeavour to expand the use of drugs for new diseases. The clinical utility of drug-repurposing artificial intelligence (AI) models remains limited because these models focus narrowly on diseases for which some drugs already exist. Here we introduce TxGNN, a graph foundation model for zero-shot drug repurposing, identifying therapeutic candidates even for diseases with limited treatment options or no existing drugs. Trained on a medical knowledge graph, TxGNN uses a graph neural network and metric learning module to rank drugs as potential indications and contraindications for 17,080 diseases. When benchmarked against 8 methods, TxGNN improves prediction accuracy for indications by 49.2% and contraindications by 35.1% under stringent zero-shot evaluation. To facilitate model interpretation, TxGNN’s Explainer module offers transparent insights into multi-hop medical knowledge paths that form TxGNN’s predictive rationales. Human evaluation of TxGNN’s Explainer showed that TxGNN’s predictions and explanations perform encouragingly on multiple axes of performance beyond accuracy. Many of TxGNN’s new predictions align well with off-label prescriptions that clinicians previously made in a large healthcare system. TxGNN’s drug-repurposing predictions are accurate, consistent with off-label drug use, and can be investigated by human experts through multi-hop interpretable rationales. Trained on a medical knowledge graph, a foundation model is used to rank drugs as potential indications and contraindications across 17,080 diseases, identifying therapeutic candidates in a zero-shot framework even for diseases with limited treatment options or no existing drugs and outperforming existing models by a large margin.},

Repurposing drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for another indication is a more rapid and less expensive option. We present DRIAD (Drug Repurposing In AD), a machine learning framework that quantifies potential associations between the pathology of AD severity (the Braak stage) and molecular mechanisms as encoded in lists of gene names. DRIAD is applied to lists of genes arising from perturbations in differentiated human neural cell cultures by 80 FDA-approved and clinically tested drugs, producing a ranked list of possible repurposing candidates. Top-scoring drugs are inspected for common trends among their targets. We propose that the DRIAD method can be used to nominate drugs that, after additional validation and identification of relevant pharmacodynamic biomarker(s), could be readily evaluated in a clinical trial. Clinical trials of novel therapeutics for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) have provided largely negative results, so far.

   abstract = {By targeting invasive organisms, antibiotics insert themselves into the ancient struggle of the host-pathogen evolutionary arms race. As pathogens evolve tactics for evading antibiotics, therapies decline in efficacy and must be replaced, distinguishing antibiotics from most other forms of drug development. Together with a slow and expensive antibiotic development pipeline, the proliferation of drug-resistant pathogens drives urgent interest in computational methods that promise to expedite candidate discovery. Strides in artificial intelligence (AI) have encouraged its application to multiple dimensions of computer-aided drug design, with increasing application to antibiotic discovery. This review describes AI-facilitated advances in the discovery of both small molecule antibiotics and antimicrobial peptides. Beyond the essential prediction of antimicrobial activity, emphasis is also given to antimicrobial compound representation, determination of drug-likeness traits, antimicrobial resistance, and de novo molecular design. Given the urgency of the antimicrobial resistance crisis, we analyze uptake of open science best practices in AI-driven antibiotic discovery and argue for openness and reproducibility as a means of accelerating preclinical research. Finally, trends in the literature and areas for future inquiry are discussed, as artificially intelligent enhancements to drug discovery at large offer many opportunities for future applications in antibiotic development. Melo, Maasch and de la Fuente-Nunez review the current practices in use of artificial intelligence in the discovery of antibiotics and antimicrobials. They also provide details about the best-practices that should be engaged with during computational drug discovery, including open science and reproducibility.},

The efflux mechanism and efflux pumps are a major reason underlying emerging rampant antibiotic resistance (AR) in microbes. To reduce the resources required and time of identification, characterization and classification of bacterial efflux proteins, we have developed a fast and accurate support vector machine based two-tier prediction system, BacEffluxPred, which can predict bacterial efflux proteins responsible for AR and identify their corresponding families. A leave-one-out cross-validation also called jackknife procedure was used for performance evaluation. The accuracy to discriminate bacterial AR efflux from non-AR efflux was obtained as 85.81% (at tier-I) while accuracies for prediction of efflux pump families like ABC, MFS, RND and MATE family were found 92.13%, 85.39%, 91.01% and 99.44%, respectively (at tier-II). Benchmarking on an independent dataset also showed that BacEffluxPred had comparable accuracy for prediction of bacterial AR efflux pumps and their families.

   abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing threat to public health. Current methods of determining AMR rely on inefficient phenotypic approaches, and there remains incomplete understanding of AMR mechanisms for many pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. Given the rapid, ongoing increase in availability of high-density genomic data for a diverse array of bacteria, development of algorithms that could utilize genomic information to predict phenotype could both be useful clinically and assist with discovery of heretofore unrecognized AMR pathways. To facilitate understanding of the connections between DNA variation and phenotypic AMR, we developed a new bioinformatics tool, variant mapping and prediction of antibiotic resistance (VAMPr), to (1) derive gene ortholog-based sequence features for protein variants; (2) interrogate these explainable gene-level variants for their known or novel associations with AMR; and (3) build accurate models to predict AMR based on whole genome sequencing data. We curated the publicly available sequencing data for 3,393 bacterial isolates from 9 species that contained AMR phenotypes for 29 antibiotics. We detected 14,615 variant genotypes and built 93 association and prediction models. The association models confirmed known genetic antibiotic resistance mechanisms, such as blaKPC and carbapenem resistance consistent with the accurate nature of our approach. The prediction models achieved high accuracies (mean accuracy of 91.1% for all antibiotic-pathogen combinations) internally through nested cross validation and were also validated using external clinical datasets. The VAMPr variant detection method, association and prediction models will be valuable tools for AMR research for basic scientists with potential for clinical applicability.},

Utilizing Shennong, we could predict individual cell responses to pharmacologic compounds, evaluate drug candidates’ tissue damaging effects, and investigate their corresponding action mechanisms. Prioritized compounds in Shennong's prediction results include FDA-approved drugs currently undergoing clinical trials for new indications, as well as drug candidates reporting anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, the tissue damaging effect prediction aligns with documented injuries and terminated discovery events.

The Multimodal Restricted Boltzmann Machine approach (MM-RBM), which has the capability to connect the information about the multiple modalities, can be applied to the problem of drug repurposing. The present study utilized MM-RBM to combine two types of data, including the chemical structures data of small molecules and differentially expressed genes as well as small molecules perturbations. In the proposed method, two separate RBMs were applied to find out the features and the specific probability distribution of each datum (modality). Besides, RBM was used to integrate the discovered features, resulting in the identification of the probability distribution of the combined data. The results demonstrated the significance of the clusters acquired by our model. These clusters were used to discover the medicines which were remarkably similar to the proposed medications to treat COVID-19. Moreover, the chemical structures of some small molecules as well as dysregulated genes’ effect led us to suggest using these molecules to treat COVID-19. The results also showed that the proposed method might prove useful in detecting the highly promising remedies for COVID-19 with minimum side effects.

Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms that learn how to accurately predict outcome variables using large sets of predictor variables that are typically not hand selected and are minimally curated. Models are parameterized using a training data set and then applied to a test data set on which predictive performance is evaluated. The application of ML algorithms to the problem of AMR has garnered increasing interest in the past 5 years due to the exponential growth of experimental and clinical data, heavy investment in computational capacity, improvements in algorithm performance, and increasing urgency for innovative approaches to reducing the burden of disease. Here, we review the current state of research at the intersection of ML and AMR with an emphasis on three domains of work. The first is the prediction of AMR using genomic data. The second is the use of ML to gain insight into the cellular functions disrupted by antibiotics, which forms the basis for understanding mechanisms of action and developing novel anti-infectives. The third focuses on the application of ML for antimicrobial stewardship using data extracted from the electronic health record. Although the use of ML for understanding, diagnosing, treating, and preventing AMR is still in its infancy, the continued growth of data and interest ensures it will become an important tool for future translational research programs.},

Existing work focuses on developing neural models to generate either molecular sequences or chemical graphs. However, it remains a big challenge to find novel and diverse compounds satisfying several properties. In this paper, we propose MARS, a method for multi-objective drug molecule discovery. MARS is based on the idea of generating the chemical candidates by iteratively editing fragments of molecular graphs. To search for high-quality candidates , it employs Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (MCMC) on molecules with an annealing scheme and an adaptive proposal. To further improve sample efficiency, MARS uses a graph neural network (GNN) to represent and select candidate edits, where the GNN is trained on-the-fly with samples from MCMC. Experiments show that MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance in various multi-objective settings where molecular bio-activity, drug-likeness, and synthe-sizability are considered. Remarkably, in the most challenging setting where all four objectives are simultaneously optimized, our approach outperforms previous methods significantly in comprehensive evaluations.

   abstract = {Background: Drug repurposing, the process of identifying additional therapeutic uses for existing drugs, has attracted increasing attention from both the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Many existing computational drug repurposing methods rely on preclinical data (e.g., chemical structures, drug targets), resulting in translational problems for clinical trials. Results: In this study, we propose a novel framework based on clinical connectivity mapping for drug repurposing to analyze therapeutic effects of drugs on diseases. We firstly establish clinical drug effect vectors (i.e., drug-laboratory results associations) by applying a continuous self-controlled case series model on a longitudinal electronic health record data, then establish clinical disease sign vectors (i.e., disease-laboratory results associations) by applying a Wilcoxon rank sum test on a large-scale national survey data. Eventually, a repurposing possibility score for each drug-disease pair is computed by applying a dot product-based scoring function on clinical disease sign vectors and clinical drug effect vectors. During the experiment, we comprehensively evaluate 392 drugs for 6 important chronic diseases (include asthma, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, heart attack, type 2 diabetes, and stroke). The experiment results not only reflect known associations between diseases and drugs, but also include some hidden drug-disease associations. The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/HoytWen/CCMDR Conclusions: The proposed clinical connectivity map framework uses laboratory results found from electronic clinical information to bridge drugs and diseases, which make their relations explainable and has better translational power than existing computational methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, further case analysis also proves our method can be used to repurposing existing drugs opportunities.},

   abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has now emerged as a chronic public health problem globally, with the forecast of 10 million deaths per year globally by 2050. AMR occurs when viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites do not respond to antimicrobial treatments in humans and animals, thus allowing the survival of the microorganism within the host. The prominent cause contributing to the current crisis remains to be the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials, particularly the inappropriate usage of antibiotics, increasing the global burden of antimicrobial resistance. The global consumption and usage of antibiotics are therefore closely monitored at all times. This review provides a current overview of the implications of strategies used by international governmental organisations, including the UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to address the problem of antibiotic resistance, as well as the “One Health Approach,” a system incorporating a multidisciplinary effort to achieve the best possible health outcome by acknowledging the clear connections between humans, animals and their shared environment. The importance of public awareness and health literacy of lay audiences still needs to be further emphasised as part of global and local action plans. Antimicrobial resistance continues to be a major global public health dilemma of the 21st century. Already this topic is receiving substantial political input from the G7 countries and continues to be on the agenda of numerous political conferences. The consequences of failure to adequately address AMR are profound, with estimations of a return to the pre-antibiotic era, where everyday infections relating to childbirth, surgery and open fractured limbs could be potentially life-threatening. AMR itself represents a microcosm of factors, including social anthropology, civil unrest/war, diasporas, ethnic displacement, political systems, healthcare, economics, societal behaviour both at a population and individual level, health literacy, geoclimatic events, global travel and pharmaceutical innovation and investment, thus finding a solution that adequately addresses AMR and which helps stem further AMR emergence is complicated. Success will involve individuals, communities and nations all working together to ensure that the world continues to possess a sufficient armamentarium of effective antimicrobials that will sustain human and animal health, both now and in the future.},

   abstract = {The computational drug repositioning aims to discover new uses for marketed drugs, which can accelerate the drug development process and play an important role in the existing drug discovery system. However, the number of validated drug-disease associations is scarce compared to the number of drugs and diseases in the real world. Too few labeled samples will make the classification model unable to learn effective latent factors of drugs, resulting in poor generalization performance. In this work, we propose a multi-task self-supervised learning framework for computational drug repositioning. The framework tackles label sparsity by learning a better drug representation. Specifically, we take the drug-disease association prediction problem as the main task, and the auxiliary task is to use data augmentation strategies and contrast learning to mine the internal relationships of the original drug features, so as to automatically learn a better drug representation without supervised labels. And through joint training, it is ensured that the auxiliary task can improve the prediction accuracy of the main task. More precisely, the auxiliary task improves drug representation and serving as additional regularization to improve generalization. Furthermore, we design a multi-input decoding network to improve the reconstruction ability of the autoencoder model. We evaluate our model using three real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the multi-task self-supervised learning framework, and its predictive ability is superior to the state-of-the-art model.},

   abstract = {Traditional antitumor drugs are cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs that can directly kill tumor cells and inhibit the growth and proliferation of tumor cells. Modern chemotherapy for tumors was initiated by use of nitrogen mustard to treat lymphomas in 1946, which was derived from mustard gas. Starting with nitrogen mustard, many kinds of anti-tumor drugs, including alkylating agents, anti-metabolism drugs, anti-tumor antibiotics, and anti-tumor plant drugs, have been successively developed for clinical treatment. Traditional antitumor drugs are the cornerstone of tumor chemotherapy and play important roles in the comprehensive treatment and neoadjuvant therapy of malignant tumors. In recent years, the combination of traditional antitumor drugs with molecular targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and radiotherapy has greatly improved the survival rate of tumor patients. With the deepening understanding of tumor genome as well as tumor initiation and promotion, the concepts of precision medicine and individualized treatment have been proposed and achieved success in clinical practice. In this context, the strategies leading to personalized therapy with traditional anti-tumor drugs also need to be further studied and optimized. This review summarized the recent clinical application and research progress of traditional antitumor drugs.},

Benzimidazole anthelmintics have broad-spectrum action to remove parasites both in human and veterinary medicine. In addition to being antiparasitic agents, benzimidazole anthelmintics are known to exert anticancer activities, such as the disruption of microtubule polymerization, the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle (G2/M) arrest, anti-angiogenesis, and blockage of glucose transport. These antitumorigenic effects even extend to cancer cells resistant to approved therapies and when in combination with conventional therapeutics, enhance anticancer efficacy and hold promise as adjuvants. Above all, these anthelmintics may offer a broad, safe spectrum to treat cancer, as demonstrated by their long history of use as antiparasitic agents. The present review summarizes central literature regarding the anticancer effects of benzimidazole anthelmintics, including albendazole, parbendazole, fenbendazole, mebendazole, oxibendazole, oxfendazole, ricobendazole, and flubendazole in cancer cell lines, animal tumor models, and clinical trials.

   abstract = {Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the dominant cause of the failure of cancer chemotherapy. The design of antitumor drugs that are able to evade MDR is rapidly evolving, showing that this area of biomedical research attracts great interest in the scientific community. The current review explores promising recent approaches that have been developed with the aim of circumventing or overcoming MDR. Encouraging results have been obtained in the investigation of the MDR-modulating properties of various classes of natural compounds and their analogues. Inhibition of P-gp or downregulation of its expression have proven to be the main mechanisms by which MDR can be surmounted. The use of hybrid molecules that are able to simultaneously interact with two or more cancer cell targets is currently being explored as a means to circumvent drug resistance. This strategy is based on the design of hybrid compounds that are obtained either by merging the structural features of separate drugs, or by conjugating two drugs or pharmacophores via cleavable/non-cleavable linkers. The approach is highly promising due to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic advantages that can be achieved over the independent administration of the two individual components. However, it should be stressed that the task of obtaining successful multivalent drugs is a very challenging one. The conjugation of anticancer agents with nitric oxide (NO) donors has recently been developed, creating a particular class of hybrid that can combat tumor drug resistance. Appropriate NO donors have been shown to reverse drug resistance via nitration of ABC transporters and by interfering with a number of metabolic enzymes and signaling pathways. In fact, hybrid compounds that are produced by covalently attaching NO-donors and antitumor drugs have been shown to elicit a synergistic cytotoxic effect in a variety of drug resistant cancer cell lines. Another strategy to circumvent MDR is based on nanocarrier-mediated transport and the controlled release of chemotherapeutic drugs and P-gp inhibitors. Their pharmacokinetics are governed by the nanoparticle or polymer carrier and make use of the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) effect, which can increase selective delivery to cancer cells. These systems are usually internalized by cancer cells via endocytosis and accumulate in endosomes and lysosomes, thus preventing rapid efflux. Other modalities to combat MDR are described in this review, including the pharmaco-modulation of acridine, which is a well-known scaffold in the development of bioactive compounds, the use of natural compounds as means to reverse MDR, and the conjugation of anticancer drugs with carriers that target specific tumor-cell components. Finally, the outstanding potential of in silico structure-based methods as a means to evaluate the ability of antitumor drugs to interact with drug transporters is also highlighted in this review. Structure-based design methods, which utilize 3D structural data of proteins and their complexes with ligands, are the most effective of the in silico methods available, as they provide a prediction regarding the interaction between transport proteins and their substrates and inhibitors. The recently resolved X-ray structure of human P-gp can help predict the interaction sites of designed compounds, providing insight into their binding mode and directing possible rational modifications to prevent them from becoming P-gp drug substrates. In summary, although major efforts were invested in the search for new tools to combat drug resistant tumors, they all require further implementation and methodological development. Further investigation and progress in the abovementioned strategies will provide significant advances in the rational combat against cancer MDR.},

Objectives: We systematically reviewed BIAs for antitumor drugs of lung cancer to provide reference for high-value drug budget impact analyses and decision making. Methods: We conducted a literature search on PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform from 2010 to 2019. The methodological indicators and result information of the budget impact analyses were extracted and evaluated for quality. Results: A total of 14 studies on the budget impact for antitumor drugs of lung cancer were included, and the overall quality was good. Half of studies were from developed countries. Nine of the studies were designed using the BIA cost calculation model, and two were simulated using the Markov model Monte Carlo model. From all studies, only 14.3% reported model validation. The budget impact results of the same drug in different countries were inconsistent. Conclusions: Included studies evaluating budget impact analyses for anti-tumor drugs of lung cancer showed variability in the methodological framework for BIAs. The budget impact analyses of high-value drugs need to be more stringent to ensure the accuracy of the parameters, and should provide reliable results based on real data to decision-making departments, which should carefully consider access to lung cancer drugs.},

The data types used to design the scoring algorithm are chemical structures, drug-target interactions (DTI), pathways, and disease-gene associations. The repurposed scoring algorithm is strengthened by integrating the most comprehensive manually curated datasets for each data type. At DrugRepo score ≥ 0.4, we repurposed 516 approved drugs across 545 diseases. Moreover, hundreds of novel predicted compounds can be matched with ongoing studies at clinical trials. Our analysis is supported by a web tool available at: http://drugrepo.org/ .},

   abstract = {Background: Reporting standards, such as PRISMA aim to ensure that the methods and results of systematic reviews are described in sufficient detail to allow full transparency. Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy-to-use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Methods and Findings: We developed a free-to-use, Open Source R package and web-based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web-based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here; https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/. Conclusions: We have developed a user-friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020-compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma_flowdiagram/). This free-to-use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.},

   abstract = {Drug repositioning greatly reduces drug development costs and time by discovering new indications for existing drugs. With the development of technology and large-scale biological databases, computational drug repositioning has increasingly attracted remarkable attention, which can narrow down repositioning candidates. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used and achieved promising results in drug repositioning. However, the existing GNNs based methods usually focus on modeling the complex drug-disease association graph, but ignore the semantic information on the graph, which may lead to a lack of consistency of global topology information and local semantic information for the learned features. To alleviate the above challenge, we propose a novel drug repositioning model based on graph contrastive learning, termed DRGCL. First, we treat the known drug-disease associations as the topology graph. Second, we select the top-<inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$K$</tex-math></inline-formula> similar neighbor from drug/disease similarity information to construct the semantic graph rather than use the traditional data augmentation strategy, thereby maximally retaining rich semantic information. Finally, we pull closer to embedding consistency of the different embedding spaces by graph contrastive learning to enhance the topology and semantic feature on the graph. We have evaluated DRGCL on four benchmark datasets and the experiment results show that the proposed DRGCL is superior to the state-of-the-art methods. Especially, the average result of DRGCL is 11.92&#x0025; higher than that of the second-best method in terms of AUPRC. The case studies further demonstrate the reliability of DRGCL. Experimental datasets and experimental codes can be found in <uri>https://github.com/Jiaxiao123/DRGCL</uri>.},

Advanced “omics” coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence (deep learning) methods have helped elucidate targets and pathways critical to those processes that may be amenable to pharmacologic modulation. However, the current anti-cancer therapeutic armamentarium continues to lag behind. As the cost of developing a new drug remains prohibitively expensive, repurposing of existing approved and investigational drugs is sought after given known safety profiles and reduction in the cost barrier. Notably, successes in oncologic drug repurposing have been infrequent. Computational in-silico strategies have been developed to aid in modeling biological processes to find new disease-relevant targets and discovering novel drug-target and drug-phenotype associations. Machine and deep learning methods have especially enabled leaps in those successes. This review will discuss these methods as they pertain to cancer biology as well as immunomodulation for drug repurposing opportunities in oncologic diseases.},

   abstract = {Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a serious threat to health, with limited effective therapeutic options, especially due to advanced stage at diagnosis and its inherent resistance to chemotherapy, making it one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The lack of clear treatment directions underscores the urgent need for innovative approaches to address and manage this deadly condition. In this research, we repurpose drugs with potential anti-cancer activity using machine learning (ML). Methods: We tackle the problem by using a neural network trained on drug–target interaction information enriched with drug–drug interaction information, which has not been used for anti-cancer drug repurposing before. We focus on eravacycline, an antibacterial drug, which was selected and evaluated to assess its anti-cancer effects. Results: Eravacycline significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of BxPC-3 cells and induced apoptosis. Conclusion: Our study highlights the potential of drug repurposing for cancer treatment using ML. Eravacycline showed promising results in inhibiting cancer cell proliferation, migration and inducing apoptosis in PDAC. These findings demonstrate that our developed ML drug repurposing models can be applied to a wide range of new oncology therapeutics, to identify potential anti-cancer agents. This highlights the potential and presents a promising approach for identifying new therapeutic options.},

   abstract = {Molecular de-extinction aims at resurrecting molecules to solve antibiotic resistance and other present-day biological and biomedical problems. Here we show that deep learning can be used to mine the proteomes of all available extinct organisms for the discovery of antibiotic peptides. We trained ensembles of deep-learning models consisting of a peptide-sequence encoder coupled with neural networks for the prediction of antimicrobial activity and used it to mine 10,311,899 peptides. The models predicted 37,176 sequences with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, 11,035 of which were not found in extant organisms. We synthesized 69 peptides and experimentally confirmed their activity against bacterial pathogens. Most peptides killed bacteria by depolarizing their cytoplasmic membrane, contrary to known antimicrobial peptides, which tend to target the outer membrane. Notably, lead compounds (including mammuthusin-2 from the woolly mammoth, elephasin-2 from the straight-tusked elephant, hydrodamin-1 from the ancient sea cow, mylodonin-2 from the giant sloth and megalocerin-1 from the extinct giant elk) showed anti-infective activity in mice with skin abscess or thigh infections. Molecular de-extinction aided by deep learning may accelerate the discovery of therapeutic molecules.

   abstract = {Due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, there is a growing need to discover new antibiotics. To address this challenge, we trained a deep neural network capable of predicting molecules with antibacterial activity. We performed predictions on multiple chemical libraries and discovered a molecule from the Drug Repurposing Hub—halicin—that is structurally divergent from conventional antibiotics and displays bactericidal activity against a wide phylogenetic spectrum of pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Halicin also effectively treated Clostridioides difficile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in murine models. Additionally, from a discrete set of 23 empirically tested predictions from >107 million molecules curated from the ZINC15 database, our model identified eight antibacterial compounds that are structurally distant from known antibiotics. This work highlights the utility of deep learning approaches to expand our antibiotic arsenal through the discovery of structurally distinct antibacterial molecules. A trained deep neural network predicts antibiotic activity in molecules that are structurally different from known antibiotics, among which Halicin exhibits efficacy against broad-spectrum bacterial infections in mice.},

   abstract = {Drug designing and development is an important area of research for pharmaceutical companies and chemical scientists. However, low efficacy, off-target delivery, time consumption, and high cost impose a hurdle and challenges that impact drug design and discovery. Further, complex and big data from genomics, proteomics, microarray data, and clinical trials also impose an obstacle in the drug discovery pipeline. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technology play a crucial role in drug discovery and development. In other words, artificial neural networks and deep learning algorithms have modernized the area. Machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been implemented in several drug discovery processes such as peptide synthesis, structure-based virtual screening, ligand-based virtual screening, toxicity prediction, drug monitoring and release, pharmacophore modeling, quantitative structure–activity relationship, drug repositioning, polypharmacology, and physiochemical activity. Evidence from the past strengthens the implementation of artificial intelligence and deep learning in this field. Moreover, novel data mining, curation, and management techniques provided critical support to recently developed modeling algorithms. In summary, artificial intelligence and deep learning advancements provide an excellent opportunity for rational drug design and discovery process, which will eventually impact mankind. The primary concern associated with drug design and development is time consumption and production cost. Further, inefficiency, inaccurate target delivery, and inappropriate dosage are other hurdles that inhibit the process of drug delivery and development. With advancements in technology, computer-aided drug design integrating artificial intelligence algorithms can eliminate the challenges and hurdles of traditional drug design and development. Artificial intelligence is referred to as superset comprising machine learning, whereas machine learning comprises supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Further, deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has been extensively implemented in drug design and development. The artificial neural network, deep neural network, support vector machines, classification and regression, generative adversarial networks, symbolic learning, and meta-learning are examples of the algorithms applied to the drug design and discovery process. Artificial intelligence has been applied to different areas of drug design and development process, such as from peptide synthesis to molecule design, virtual screening to molecular docking, quantitative structure–activity relationship to drug repositioning, protein misfolding to protein–protein interactions, and molecular pathway identification to polypharmacology. Artificial intelligence principles have been applied to the classification of active and inactive, monitoring drug release, pre-clinical and clinical development, primary and secondary drug screening, biomarker development, pharmaceutical manufacturing, bioactivity identification and physiochemical properties, prediction of toxicity, and identification of mode of action.},

However, their clinical development is limited by toxicity to human cells, a parameter which is very difficult to control. Given the similarity between peptide sequences and words, large language models (LLMs) might be able to predict AMP activity and toxicity. To test this hypothesis, we fine-tuned LLMs using data from the Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP). GPT-3 performed well but not reproducibly for activity prediction and hemolysis, taken as a proxy for toxicity. The later GPT-3.5 performed more poorly and was surpassed by recurrent neural networks (RNN) trained on sequence-activity data or support vector machines (SVM) trained on MAP4C molecular fingerprint-activity data. These simpler models are therefore recommended, although the rapid evolution of LLMs warrants future re-evaluation of their prediction abilities.},

   abstract = {Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a common rebalancing strategy for handling imbalanced tabular data sets. However, few works analyze SMOTE theoretically. In this paper, we derive several non-asymptotic upper bound on SMOTE density. From these results, we prove that SMOTE (with default parameter) tends to copy the original minority samples asymptotically. We confirm and illustrate empirically this first theoretical behavior on a real-world data-set.bFurthermore, we prove that SMOTE density vanishes near the boundary of the support of the minority class distribution. We then adapt SMOTE based on our theoretical findings to introduce two new variants. These strategies are compared on 13 tabular data sets with 10 state-of-the-art rebalancing procedures, including deep generative and diffusion models. One of our key findings is that, for most data sets, applying no rebalancing strategy is competitive in terms of predictive performances, would it be with LightGBM, tuned random forests or logistic regression. However, when the imbalance ratio is artificially augmented, one of our two modifications of SMOTE leads to promising predictive performances compared to SMOTE and other state-of-the-art strategies.},

To manage the pace of annotation with that of data generation, there is a shift to computational approaches which are based on homology, sequence and structure-based features, protein-protein interaction networks, phylogenetic profiles, and physicochemical properties, etc. A combination of these features has proven to be promising for protein function prediction in terms of improving prediction accuracy. In the present work, we have employed a combination of features based on sequence, physicochemical property, subsequence and annotation features with a total of 9890 features extracted and/or calculated for 171,212 reviewed prokaryotic proteins of 9 bacterial phyla from UniProtKB, to train a supervised deep learning ensemble model with the aim to categorize a bacterial hypothetical/unreviewed protein's function into 1739 GO terms as functional classes. The proposed system being fully dedicated to bacterial organisms is a novel attempt amongst various existing machine learning based protein function prediction systems based on mixed organisms. Experimental results demonstrate the success of the proposed deep learning ensemble model based on deep neural network method with F1 measure of 0.7912 on the prepared Test dataset 1 of reviewed proteins.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Dengue Fever continues to pose a global threat due to the widespread distribution of its vector mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. While the WHO-approved vaccine, Dengvaxia, and antiviral treatments like Balapiravir and Celgosivir are available, challenges such as drug resistance, reduced efficacy, and high treatment costs persist. This study aims to identify novel potential inhibitors of the Dengue virus (DENV) using an integrative drug discovery approach encompassing machine learning and molecular docking techniques. Method: Utilizing a dataset of 21,250 bioactive compounds from PubChem (AID: 651640), alongside a total of 1,444 descriptors generated using PaDEL, we trained various models such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, k-nearest neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes. The top-performing model was used to predict active compounds, followed by molecular docking performed using AutoDock Vina. The detailed interactions, toxicity, stability, and conformational changes of selected compounds were assessed through protein-ligand interaction studies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding free energy calculations. Results: We implemented a robust three-dataset splitting strategy, employing the Logistic Regression algorithm, which achieved an accuracy of 94%. The model successfully predicted 18 known DENV inhibitors, with 11 identified as active, paving the way for further exploration of 2683 new compounds from the ZINC and EANPDB databases. Subsequent molecular docking studies were performed on the NS2B/NS3 protease, an enzyme essential in viral replication. ZINC95485940, ZINC38628344, 2′,4′-dihydroxychalcone and ZINC14441502 demonstrated a high binding affinity of −8.1, −8.5, −8.6, and −8.0 kcal/mol, respectively, exhibiting stable interactions with His51, Ser135, Leu128, Pro132, Ser131, Tyr161, and Asp75 within the active site, which are critical residues involved in inhibition. Molecular dynamics simulations coupled with MMPBSA further elucidated the stability, making it a promising candidate for drug development. Conclusion: Overall, this integrative approach, combining machine learning, molecular docking, and dynamics simulations, highlights the strength and utility of computational tools in drug discovery. It suggests a promising pathway for the rapid identification and development of novel antiviral drugs against DENV. These in silico findings provide a strong foundation for future experimental validations and in-vitro studies aimed at fighting DENV.},

   abstract = {Despite recent advances in computational protein science, the dynamic behavior of proteins, which directly governs their biological activity, cannot be gleaned from sequence information alone. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework that integrates the peptide sequence, protein structure, and protein dynamics descriptors into machine learning algorithms to enhance their predictive capabilities and achieve improved prediction of the protein variant function. The resulting machine learning pipeline integrates traditional sequence and structure information with molecular dynamics simulation data to predict the effects of multiple point mutations on the fold improvement of the activity of bovine enterokinase variants. This study highlights how the combination of structural and dynamic data can provide predictive insights into protein functionality and address protein engineering challenges in industrial contexts. ■ INTRODUCTION Proteins are essential, powerful machines in biology and consequently find a wide range of application areas in biotechnology, including the manufacturing of targeted therapies. However, their development as a functional product is expensive, time-consuming, and frequently yields unsuccessful results. 1 The estimated average cost of bringing a new protein-based therapy to market is between $1 and $3 billion, and the success rate of clinical trials is below 10%. To overcome these obstacles, researchers are investigating new methods for expediting the engineering of proteins with enhanced functionality and manufacturability. Protein engineering entails making precise alterations to the original sequence of a protein to identify variants with desirable properties while minimizing interference with its function. Thus, protein engineering has revolutionized the production and use of protein-based products. 2 However, due to the vast number of possible amino acid combinations, exhaustive experimental exploration of the landscape of protein fitness remains nearly impossible. 3−6 Theoretically, the scope of mutations could be restricted to include only the ostensibly significant fragments of the protein such as the binding sites. However, this remains a heuristic solution applicable to a limited number of cases, as the majority of protein properties depend on the entire sequence and structural conformation, not just a few amino acids, due to the presence of epistatic effects. 7,8 Biodescriptors are quantitative characteristics that shed light on a protein's chemistry and structure. Algorithms can use the information contained in biodescriptors to predict the effects of amino acid substitutions on the properties of proteins. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have been applied to the classification of proteins and the prediction of the stability of protein−ligand complexes. 9−13 Nevertheless, biodescriptors, which incorporate function-related properties associated with the macromolecules, were not employed in the investigation of the role of mutations introduced into the protein sequence on protein performance. 14−16 Unsupervised ML methods mostly use natural language processing (NLP) to obtain sequence-level information for protein prediction. Recently, generative models that are able to design effective and diverse proteins suitable for various applications have received substantial attention, owing to their promise and potential. These models are all based on the assumption that sequence-based information, i.e., the order of the amino acids in a given length of peptide sequence, encompasses both structure and function information in its entirety. However, a true understanding of the physics and},

However, their use in therapy has been complicated by severe side effects and toxicity that occur during or after treatment, including cardiotoxicity. The mode of action of anthracyclines is complex, with several mechanisms proposed. It is possible that their high toxicity is due to the large set of processes involved in anthracycline action. The development of resistance is a major barrier to successful treatment when using anthracyclines. This resistance is based on a series of mechanisms that have been studied and addressed in recent years. This work provides an overview of the anthracyclines used in cancer therapy. It discusses their mechanisms of activity, toxicity, and chemoresistance, as well as the approaches used to improve their activity, decrease their toxicity, and overcome resistance.},

Our aim was to assess the effectiveness of adjuvant MMC and compare different MMC regimens in preventing recurrence. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in November 2023 for studies investigating recurrence-free survival (RFS) among patients with IR-NMIBC who received adjuvant MMC. Prospective trials with different MMC regimens or other intravesical drugs as comparators were considered eligible. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall, 14 studies were eligible for systematic review and 11 for meta-analysis of RFS. Estimates of 1-yr, 2-yr, and 5-yr RFS rates were 84% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79-89%), 75% (95% CI 68-82%), and 51% (95% CI 40-63%) for patients treated with MMC induction plus maintenance, and 88% (95% CI 83-94%), 78% (95% CI 67-89%), and 66% (95% CI 57-75%) for patients treated with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) maintenance, respectively. Estimates of 2-yr RFS rates for MMC maintenance regimens were 76% (95% CI 69-84%) for 40 mg MMC (2 studies) and 66% (95% CI 60-72%) for 30 mg MMC (4 studies). Among the studies included, BCG maintenance provided comparable 2-yr RFS to 40 mg MMC with maintenance (78% vs 76%). RFS did not differ by MMC maintenance duration (>1 yr vs 1 yr vs <1 yr). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: MMC induction and maintenance regimens seem to provide short-term RFS rates equivalent to those for BCG maintenance in IR-NMIBC. For adjuvant induction and maintenance, 40 mg of MMC appears to be more effective in preventing recurrence than 30 mg. We did not observe an RFS benefit for longer maintenance regimens. PATIENT SUMMARY: For patients with intermediate-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer, bladder treatments with a solution of a drug called mitomycin C (MMC) seem to be as effective as BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guérin) in preventing recurrence after tumor removal. Further trials are needed for stronger evidence on the best MMC dose and treatment time.},

   abstract = {Background: We analysed 48 non-redundant antibiotic target proteins from all bacteria, 22 antibiotic target proteins from E. coli only and 4243 non-drug targets from E. coli to identify differences in their properties and to predict new potential drug targets.Results: When compared to non-targets, bacterial antibiotic targets tend to be long, have high β-sheet and low α-helix contents, are polar, are found in the cytoplasm rather than in membranes, and are usually enzymes, with ligases particularly favoured. Sequence features were used to build a support vector machine model for E. coli proteins, allowing the assignment of any sequence to the drug target or non-target classes, with an accuracy in the training set of 94%. We identified 319 proteins (7%) in the non-target set that have target-like properties, many of which have unknown function. 63 of these proteins have significant and undesirable similarity to a human protein, leaving 256 target like proteins that are not present in humans.Conclusions: We suggest that antibiotic discovery programs would be more likely to succeed if new targets are chosen from this set of target like proteins or their homologues.
